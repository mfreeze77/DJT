## Tevfik Arif

### Background & Biography
Tevfik Arif is a Kazakh-born real estate developer and former Soviet official. Born in 1953 to a Turkish family in the Kazakh SSR, he earned a degree in international relations in Moscow ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=Tevfik%20Arif%20was%20born%20to,Ministry%20of%20Commerce%20and%20Trade)). For 17 years, Arif served as a deputy director in the USSR’s Ministry of Commerce and Trade, specializing in hotel management ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=Tevfik%20Arif%20was%20born%20to,Ministry%20of%20Commerce%20and%20Trade)). After the Soviet Union collapsed, Arif and his brother ventured into private business – including jewelry and a chromium factory – leveraging their high-level connections to invest in real estate projects in Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=With%20the%20break%20up%20of,his%20firm%20the%20Bayrock%20Group)). In 2001, Arif moved part of his operations to New York and founded Bayrock Group, a real estate development firm, establishing its headquarters on the 24th floor of Trump Tower in Manhattan ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=In%202003%2C%20Trump%27s%20business%20trajectory,Committee%20to%20Investigate)) ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=2001%2C%20Tevrik%20moved%20part%20of,his%20firm%20the%20Bayrock%20Group)). 

Arif’s background drew scrutiny for possible ties to organized crime and illicit activities. In 2010, he was arrested in Turkey on charges of running a high-end prostitution ring aboard a $60 million yacht (once owned by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Tevfik%20Arif%20had%20his%20own,Committee%20to%20Investigate)). Turkish authorities alleged the ring provided underage girls to wealthy businessmen, including Russian and Kazakh elites ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Tevfik%20Arif%20had%20his%20own,acquitted%20by%20a%20Turkish%20court)). Arif fought the charges and was **acquitted in 2012** by a Turkish court ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Tevfik%20Arif%20had%20his%20own,Committee%20to%20Investigate)). Despite this legal scare, Arif remained a free man and continued his business dealings. However, Bayrock’s later legal troubles (detailed below) and Arif’s 2010 arrest cast a long shadow over his reputation.

### Interactions with Donald Trump
Arif’s relationship with Donald Trump began in **2003**. That year, Arif’s Bayrock Group (which had set up offices in Trump Tower) hired Felix Sater, a Soviet-born businessman with a criminal past, as managing director ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Arif%20had%20hired%20Felix%20Sater,Committee%20to%20Investigate)) ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,wanted%20to%20expand%20his%20portfolio)). Sater introduced Arif to Trump in 2003, pitching Trump on Bayrock’s development plans ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Committee%20to%20Investigate%20Russia%20investigaterussia,Committee%20to%20Investigate)). Trump was impressed by Arif’s international connections and agreed to explore partnerships ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Trump%2C%20impressed%20by%20Arif%27s%20international,minimal%20personal%20capital%20at%20risk)). They soon forged a business alliance: Trump would license his famous name and sometimes take an equity stake in Bayrock’s projects, while Arif’s Bayrock would arrange financing and development ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Trump%2C%20impressed%20by%20Arif%27s%20international,minimal%20personal%20capital%20at%20risk)). This partnership was mutually beneficial – Trump expanded his brand globally with minimal capital at risk, and Bayrock gained the cachet of the Trump name for its ventures ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Trump%2C%20impressed%20by%20Arif%27s%20international,minimal%20personal%20capital%20at%20risk)).

From **2003 to 2010**, Arif and Trump worked together on multiple real estate projects, with Bayrock as a principal partner. The most prominent was **Trump SoHo** in New York, announced in 2006. Bayrock (Arif) and the Sapir Organization (headed by Soviet-born investor Tamir Sapir) co-developed the $450 million condo-hotel, while Trump lent his brand and took an 18% equity stake ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=1,The%20Moscow%20Project)) ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=Their%20most%20high%20profile%20project,share)). Trump’s children Ivanka and Donald Jr. were actively involved in Trump SoHo’s development and launch ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=1,Europe%20and%20Central%20Asia)). Arif appeared alongside Trump and the Trump children at the SoHo project’s launch events in September 2007 ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Trump%20SoHo%20was%20the%20signature,the%20project%20opened%20in%202010)) ([Trump’s Soviet pimp crime partner Arif a major donor to Chabad | Fitzpatrick Informer](https://fitzinfo.net/2021/03/07/trumps-soviet-pimp-crime-partner-arif-a-major-donor-to-chabad/)), underscoring their close working relationship. 

Other collaborations included proposed Trump-branded projects in Fort Lauderdale, Phoenix/Scottsdale, and even Moscow. In 2005–2007, Arif’s team (through Sater) pursued a Trump Tower Moscow deal, going so far as to sign a tentative letter of intent and scout locations ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=4,The%20Moscow%20Project)). Trump acknowledged this Moscow proposal in a deposition later, though the deal fell through ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=4,Europe%20and%20Central%20Asia)). Throughout these years, Arif and Bayrock essentially became Trump’s gateway to international – especially post-Soviet – investment opportunities.

The partnership began to sour by **2010**. That year, Bayrock’s finance director Jody Kriss sued the company (and by extension Arif and Sater), alleging pervasive fraud (more below) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=The%20Bayrock%20relationship%20eventually%20led,Business%20Insider)). Around the same time, Trump SoHo’s sales floundered and Trump faced lawsuits from buyers for allegedly misrepresenting sales figures ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=By%202011%2C%20the%20project%20faced,Business)). By 2011, Trump and his children settled a civil fraud complaint from condo buyers by refunding deposits (with no admission of wrongdoing) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=By%202011%2C%20the%20project%20faced,Business%20Insider)) ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=In%20November%202011%2C%20Trump%20SoHo,Arif%20reportedly%20moved%20to%20Turkey)). The SoHo project ultimately went into foreclosure and was taken over by new investors in 2014, effectively ending the Trump-Bayrock venture ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=In%20November%202011%2C%20Trump%20SoHo,Arif%20reportedly%20moved%20to%20Turkey)). By then, Bayrock had largely ceased operations and Arif retreated from the U.S. real estate scene, reportedly relocating to Turkey ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=In%20November%202011%2C%20Trump%20SoHo,Arif%20reportedly%20moved%20to%20Turkey)). Trump, for his part, began distancing himself, claiming under oath that he “never really understood who owned Bayrock” despite years of dealings ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=When%20Trump%20testified%20under%20oath,%E2%80%9D)).

### Financial, Criminal, or Political Connections
Tevfik Arif sits at the nexus of business and the murkier side of post-Soviet finance. Through Bayrock, he aggressively courted capital from Eastern Europe and Central Asia. In **2007**, Bayrock received a **$50 million investment** from Iceland’s FL Group, a firm reputed to be backed by Russian oligarchs “in favor” with Vladimir Putin ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Bayrock%20actively%20sought%20capital%20from,Committee%20to%20Investigate%20Russia)) ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=In%202007%2C%20Bayrock%20secured%20%2450,In%20December%202016%2C%20a%20New)). According to court filings, this infusion – used to fund Trump SoHo – was allegedly *Russian state-linked money* seeking safe investment abroad ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Bayrock%20actively%20sought%20capital%20from,Committee%20to%20Investigate%20Russia)) ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=In%202007%2C%20Bayrock%20secured%20%2450,In%20December%202016%2C%20a%20New)). Bayrock also had mysterious cash flows: Jody Kriss’s lawsuit claimed Bayrock got “**unexplained infusions of cash from accounts in Kazakhstan and Russia**” and functioned as a money laundering front ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=President%20Vladimir%20V,forward%20as%20a%20racketeering%20case)). These allegations painted Arif’s company as a vehicle for moving suspect funds into U.S. real estate, with Trump-branded projects as the attractive façade.

Arif’s personal history bolsters suspicions about criminal ties. His decision to hire Felix Sater – who had known links to Russian organized crime – as Bayrock’s managing director suggests a comfort with underworld-connected figures ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Arif%20had%20hired%20Felix%20Sater,on%20licensing%20his%20name%20to)) ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,wanted%20to%20expand%20his%20portfolio)). In fact, Sater’s father had worked for Semion Mogilevich (a major Russian mafia boss), indicating that Bayrock’s leadership was intertwined with mob networks from the start ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Felix%20Sater%27s%20connections%20to%20Russia,Trump%27s%20Business%20%E2%80%93%20Foreign%20Policy)). Arif’s own 2010 arrest for an alleged prostitution ring (though he was acquitted) hinted at connections to illicit enterprises and influential patrons (the yacht party reportedly involved wealthy Russian and Central Asian businessmen) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Tevfik%20Arif%20had%20his%20own,acquitted%20by%20a%20Turkish%20court)). While Arif was never convicted of a crime, these incidents raised **intelligence flags**. Law enforcement and later congressional investigators took interest in Bayrock: a 2019 Senate Intelligence Committee report described Bayrock as having “Russian-connected money” and highlighted Arif’s 2010 arrest as a point of concern in vetting Trump’s associates ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=In%202007%2C%20Bayrock%20secured%20%2450,In%20December%202016%2C%20a%20New)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Tevfik%20Arif%20had%20his%20own,Committee%20to%20Investigate)).

Politically, Arif was not a public figure or donor, but his access to elites in Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkey implies possible influence-peddling. He cultivated relationships with ex-Soviet officials and oligarchs (for example, Kazakhstan’s oligarch Alexander Mashkevich was implicated as an associate on the Savarona yacht) ([Trump’s Soviet pimp crime partner Arif a major donor to Chabad | Fitzpatrick Informer](https://fitzinfo.net/2021/03/07/trumps-soviet-pimp-crime-partner-arif-a-major-donor-to-chabad/#:~:text=defendants,Minister%20of%20Kazakhstan%20Karim%20Massimov)). Such ties suggest that Arif operated within transnational patronage networks that mixed business with politics. U.S. authorities later scrutinized whether those networks used Trump deals to launder money or curry favor. In short, Arif brought a web of post-Soviet financial connections into Trump’s orbit – connections that came with significant legal and reputational risk.

### Broader Role in the Network
Within Trump’s network, Tevfik Arif was a **key facilitator of Russian and post-Soviet money** entering Trump’s businesses in the 2000s. He was effectively the bridge between Trump and a new pool of Eastern financiers at a time when Trump’s U.S. funding sources were limited. By partnering with Bayrock, Trump gained entree to capital from the former USSR that helped revive his real estate ventures ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=However%2C%20Trump%20still%20faced%20significant,money%20into%20Western%20real%20estate)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Trump%2C%20impressed%20by%20Arif%27s%20international,minimal%20personal%20capital%20at%20risk)). Arif’s Bayrock exemplified the pattern of Trump aligning with obscure foreign developers who could bankroll projects under Trump’s brand. This arrangement set the template for later deals in places like Canada (Toronto) and Georgia, where Trump licenses were backed by ex-Soviet money.

Arif’s network included figures like **Tamir Sapir** (his Trump SoHo co-partner) and **Felix Sater**, as well as wealthy Russians who invested in Bayrock deals via shell companies ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=In%202007%2C%20Bayrock%20secured%20%2450,In%20December%202016%2C%20a%20New)). Thus, Arif sits at the center of a **cluster of Soviet-born businessmen in Trump’s orbit**, all of whom had interconnections with Russian oligarchs or organized crime. This cluster greatly deepened Trump’s entanglement with post-Soviet interests. By 2013, for example, Trump was leveraging contacts that originated with Arif/Bayrock to pursue a Moscow tower with Aras Agalarov ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Throughout%20his%20Moscow%20visit%2C%20Trump,Wikipedia)). In essence, Arif’s role was to open the floodgates for Russian capital and contacts – his partnership with Trump was “phase one” of Trump’s Russian entanglements.

When viewed in the broader context, Arif’s relationship with Trump provided a blueprint for how foreign influence could take root in Trump’s business empire. It showcased the *symbiosis* between Trump’s cash-starved ventures and oligarchic wealth seeking legitimacy or safe haven. The Bayrock episode foreshadowed later controversies, from suspicious condo buyers to the 2013 Moscow pageant. Investigators have noted that by embedding with Arif, Trump became enmeshed (wittingly or not) in a network that U.S. intelligence considers rife with **money laundering and potential Kremlin influence** ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=,Trump%27s%20Business%20%E2%80%93%20Foreign%20Policy)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Policy%20foreignpolicy,Trump%27s%20Business%20%E2%80%93%20Foreign%20Policy)). Tevfik Arif, though now a low-profile figure, is thus a crucial node linking Trump to the post-Soviet financial web that would raise national security alarms in subsequent years.

## Felix Sater

### Background & Biography
Felix Sater (born Felix Mikhailovich Sheferovsky in 1966) is a Russian-born American businessman with a colorful and notorious past. He emigrated from the USSR to Brooklyn as a child in the 1970s ([Felix Sater | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/felix-sater#:~:text=Sater%20moved%20to%20Brooklyn%2C%20NY,and%20Trump%20Organization%20vice%20president)). In his youth, Sater became involved in Wall Street but quickly ran afoul of the law. In 1991, at age 25, he got into a bar fight in Manhattan where he smashed a margarita glass into another broker’s face, slicing the victim and eventually serving a year in prison for assault ([Why Robert Mueller Has Trump SoHo in His Sights | Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/08/why-robert-mueller-has-trump-soho-in-his-sights#:~:text=In%201991%2C%20Sater%2C%20then%20a,%E2%80%9D)). Far from going straight, Sater next became involved in a massive **stock fraud scheme** in the mid-1990s. In 1998 he pleaded guilty to a $40 million “pump-and-dump” securities fraud that was linked to both the New York Mafia and Russian organized crime ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Committee%20to%20Investigate%20Russia%20investigaterussia,With%20Trump%20SoHo%20Developed%20With)) ([Felix Sater | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/felix-sater#:~:text=glass,a%20weapons%20sale%20in%20Afghanistan)). To avoid a lengthy prison term, Sater decided to cooperate with U.S. authorities. He became an FBI informant, reportedly feeding the government information on organized crime networks and even on terrorism (at one point providing contacts that helped hunt down **Osama bin Laden**’s phone number) ([Judge confirms Trump associate gave feds Osama bin Laden’s number - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/16/felix-sater-osama-bin-laden-trump-number-1329662#:~:text=Image%3A%20Trump%20Tower)) ([Judge confirms Trump associate gave feds Osama bin Laden’s number - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/16/felix-sater-osama-bin-laden-trump-number-1329662#:~:text=A%20federal%20judge%20has%20confirmed,track%20down%20Osama%20bin%20Laden)). 

By the early 2000s, Sater was out of prison and looking to reinvent himself as a real estate dealmaker. Despite his criminal record (which was initially sealed), he joined Tevfik Arif’s Bayrock Group in 2003 as managing director ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Arif%20had%20hired%20Felix%20Sater,on%20licensing%20his%20name%20to)). Sater brought to Bayrock not only business acumen but also his underworld connections. Notably, his father, Mikhail Sheferovsky, was an alleged lieutenant for Russian mob boss Semion Mogilevich ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Felix%20Sater%27s%20connections%20to%20Russia,Trump%27s%20Business%20%E2%80%93%20Foreign%20Policy)), meaning Felix had direct ties to one of the most powerful organized crime figures in the post-Soviet world. U.S. intelligence has considered Mogilevich a top transnational crime threat (he remains on the FBI’s wanted list), and Sater’s proximity to him is a recurrent red flag in Sater’s profile ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Felix%20Sater%27s%20connections%20to%20Russia,Trump%27s%20Business%20%E2%80%93%20Foreign%20Policy)). Sater’s unique double life – convicted felon turned FBI informant, with one foot in the legitimate business world and one in the criminal underworld – makes his biography “fascinating” and at times troubling ([Felix Sater's Fascinating Past | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/media/2018-03-12/felix-saters-fascinating-past#:~:text=Felix%20Sater%27s%20Fascinating%20Past%20,investigators%20in%20the%20Russia%20probe)).

### Interactions with Donald Trump
Felix Sater is one of the most pivotal conduits between Donald Trump and Russia-linked business opportunities during the 2000s. Sater first met Trump around **2003** after he joined Bayrock Group. That year, Sater personally introduced Bayrock’s founder Tevfik Arif to Trump in Trump Tower ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Committee%20to%20Investigate%20Russia%20investigaterussia,Committee%20to%20Investigate)). This introduction led to Bayrock partnering with the Trump Organization on multiple projects (Trump SoHo, etc.), with Sater often on the front lines as Bayrock’s deal negotiator. Trump was aware of Sater’s role, if not his full criminal history at the time. In a 2007 email, Sater even recalled showing Ivanka Trump around Moscow’s Kremlin and seating her in Vladimir Putin’s chair during a business trip, demonstrating his access in Russia ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=opportunities,Business%20Insider)).

Throughout **2005–2007**, Sater worked closely with Trump and Trump’s children on various ventures. He became a **key point man for international Trump projects**, thanks to his Russian and Eastern European network. For instance, Sater spearheaded Bayrock’s efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. In 2006–07, he scouted sites in Moscow and secured a letter of intent for a Moscow development under Trump’s name ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=4,The%20Moscow%20Project)). While Trump Moscow (Version 1) ultimately fell through, Trump later testified that Sater had brought him this deal and that they had discussed it in meetings ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=4,The%20Moscow%20Project)). Sater was also involved in Trump projects in Fort Lauderdale and Phoenix, and he helped launch Trump SoHo – appearing on stage with Trump at the September 2007 launch party ([Trump’s Soviet pimp crime partner Arif a major donor to Chabad | Fitzpatrick Informer](https://fitzinfo.net/2021/03/07/trumps-soviet-pimp-crime-partner-arif-a-major-donor-to-chabad/)). Multiple witnesses say Sater had an office in Trump Tower and was in regular contact with Trump during these years, essentially acting as an **ambassador of the Trump brand to foreign investors** ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Felix%20Sater%27s%20criminal%20past%20also,Business%20Insider)) ([Why Robert Mueller Has Trump SoHo in His Sights | Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/08/why-robert-mueller-has-trump-soho-in-his-sights#:~:text=his%20latest%20partner%20by%20surprise,%E2%80%9D)).

However, as Sater’s past came to light, Trump began to downplay their relationship. In **2007**, Sater’s prior felony convictions were unsealed in a court case, embarrassing Trump ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Felix%20Sater%27s%20criminal%20past%20also,Business%20Insider)). By 2008–2010, when Bayrock became entangled in lawsuits, Trump tried to distance himself. Famously, in a 2013 deposition, Trump claimed, “If [Sater] were sitting in the room right now, I really wouldn’t know what he looked like” ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Felix%20Sater%27s%20criminal%20past%20also,Business%20Insider)) – an unlikely assertion given Sater’s years of working alongside him. Despite Trump’s public denials, evidence shows Sater continued to interact with Trump’s organization. Notably, Sater carried on pitching the Trump Tower Moscow idea. In **2015**, he emailed Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen bragging that he could get Putin’s support for a new Trump Moscow deal and that it would help Trump win the presidency (“Our boy can become president... I can get Putin on this program”) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=had%20reportedly%20worked%20for%20Semion,Trump%27s%20Business%20%E2%80%93%20Foreign%20Policy)) ([Felix Sater | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/felix-sater#:~:text=Sater%E2%80%99s%20name%20emerged%20again%20on,the%20stalled%20Trump%20Tower%20Moscow)). This indicates that even after formal business ties lapsed, Sater remained in Trump’s orbit, trying to broker grand deals linking Trump and Russia.

In summary, Sater was instrumental in **several high-level interactions** between Trump and Russia-linked figures: he connected Trump with Russian investors for projects, personally accompanied the Trump family in Moscow, and persisted in pushing a Moscow tower through 2016. His interactions with Trump span from legitimate real estate ventures to geopolitical maneuvering, highlighting his outsize influence as a Trump associate.

### Financial, Criminal, or Political Connections
Felix Sater’s connections are a study in overlapping spheres of finance, organized crime, and global politics. On the financial front, Sater was involved in large-scale real estate and investment deals. As Bayrock’s front man, he helped secure funding from sources that later raised eyebrows – e.g. the **FL Group $50 million investment** linked to Putin-favored oligarchs for Trump SoHo ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=In%202007%2C%20Bayrock%20secured%20%2450,In%20December%202016%2C%20a%20New)). Sater’s own fortunes soared as he leveraged his Trump connections: he reportedly took home millions from Bayrock deals and later sought to profit from new ventures (such as a failed attempt to redevelop Moscow’s Stalin-era hotel network with Trump licensing) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=4,The%20Moscow%20Project)) ([Felix Sater | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/felix-sater#:~:text=Sater%E2%80%99s%20name%20emerged%20again%20on,the%20stalled%20Trump%20Tower%20Moscow)).

Criminally, Sater’s history is well-documented. He is a **convicted felon** (assault and stock fraud) and has been accused of having longstanding ties to mafia groups ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Committee%20to%20Investigate%20Russia%20investigaterussia,With%20Trump%20SoHo%20Developed%20With)) ([Felix Sater | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/felix-sater#:~:text=managing%20director%20for%20Bayrock%20Group%2C,Russian%20and%20American%20organized%20crime)). The 1990s stock scam he ran was connected to the Genovese and Bonanno crime families in New York, as well as Russian mobsters in Brighton Beach ([Why Robert Mueller Has Trump SoHo in His Sights | Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/08/why-robert-mueller-has-trump-soho-in-his-sights#:~:text=In%201991%2C%20Sater%2C%20then%20a,%E2%80%9D)). Instead of serving a long sentence, Sater cooperated secretly with the U.S. government. For nearly a decade, he fed information to federal prosecutors and intelligence agencies, purportedly on matters ranging from mob money laundering to black market arms deals ([Judge confirms Trump associate gave feds Osama bin Laden’s number - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/16/felix-sater-osama-bin-laden-trump-number-1329662#:~:text=the%202016%20election%2C%20helped%20the,track%20down%20Osama%20bin%20Laden)). A federal judge in 2019 confirmed that Sater provided the FBI with Osama bin Laden’s telephone number and other “very interesting and dangerous” intelligence during those years ([Judge confirms Trump associate gave feds Osama bin Laden’s number - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/16/felix-sater-osama-bin-laden-trump-number-1329662#:~:text=During%20a%20hearing%20on%20Thursday,decade%20as%20an%20FBI%20informant)). This undercover work complicates Sater’s profile: while he has criminal associates, he also worked with U.S. officials against some of those same figures. Critics have noted that Sater walked a fine line – some suspect he continued shady dealings even while cooperating. For example, Kazakhstan’s BTA Bank has alleged that Sater later attempted to launder stolen Kazakh funds through a proposed Trump Tower Moscow deal in 2012–2013 ([Bank Sues Sater Over Alleged Money Laundering](https://investigaterussia.org/media/2019-03-25/bank-sues-sater-over-alleged-money-laundering#:~:text=Former%20Trump%20business%20associate%20and,tower%20deal%20in%202012)), a scheme now under litigation.

Politically, Sater’s influence is usually behind-the-scenes, but significant. He had no official government role, yet in **February 2017**, Sater emerged as an unlikely backchannel diplomat: he joined Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen in delivering a pro-Russia Ukraine “peace plan” to then-National Security Advisor Michael Flynn ([Felix Sater | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/felix-sater#:~:text=In%20February%20of%202017%2C%20a,sensitive%20matter%20of%20national%20security)). This freelance diplomacy (which also involved a pro-Kremlin Ukrainian politician) was highly irregular and showed Sater leveraging his connections for geopolitical purposes. Moreover, Sater is connected to Russian oligarch **Oleg Deripaska** and to **Paul Manafort**. Senate investigators learned Sater had worked with Manafort and Deripaska on a 2015 Ukraine deal, indicating he had entree with Putin’s inner circle via Deripaska ([Tell Us, Mr. Sater, About Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin - WhoWhatWhy](https://whowhatwhy.org/politics/government-integrity/tell-us-mr-sater-about-donald-trump-and-vladimir-putin/#:~:text=Oleg%20Deripaska%20and%20associates)). Sater’s name also appears in the Mueller investigation: he was subpoenaed by Congress in 2019 and testified (closed-door) about the Trump Moscow negotiations and possibly money laundering angles ([Bank Sues Sater Over Alleged Money Laundering](https://investigaterussia.org/media/2019-03-25/bank-sues-sater-over-alleged-money-laundering#:~:text=Bank%20Sues%20Sater%20Over%20Alleged,tower%20deal%20in%202012)). Intelligence agencies have undoubtedly taken interest in Sater’s activities, given that he intersects with Russian mob bosses, Kremlin-tied billionaires, and members of Trump’s campaign. 

In sum, Sater’s connections range from **Mafia to Moscow to Mueller**. His ability to operate in corrupt financial channels (stock fraud, money laundering), connect with mob figures (Mogilevich’s network), and engage in political intrigue (Ukraine peace plans) made him a uniquely positioned actor in Trump’s sphere. While he portrayed himself as an American patriot helping law enforcement, many remain skeptical and view him as a **career opportunist enmeshed in criminal and espionage-tinged affairs**.

### Broader Role in the Network
Felix Sater is arguably the **linchpin** of Trump’s Russia-related network in the pre-2014 period. Through Sater, Trump gained personal access to a web of Russian and post-Soviet oligarchs, bureaucrats, and fixers that would have been otherwise out of reach. Sater introduced Trump not just to Bayrock and Arif, but to the wider constellation of ex-Soviet money men hungry to invest abroad. For example, Sater’s efforts were key in bringing Russian capital into Trump projects (like the condo buyers and FL Group funding in Trump SoHo) ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=In%202007%2C%20Bayrock%20secured%20%2450,In%20December%202016%2C%20a%20New)). He also kept the idea of a Moscow Trump Tower alive for over a decade, acting as a go-between for Trump with Russian officials and potential financiers ([Felix Sater | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/felix-sater#:~:text=Sater%E2%80%99s%20name%20emerged%20again%20on,the%20stalled%20Trump%20Tower%20Moscow)).

Within the Trump orbit, Sater had an unusual dual reputation – to some inside the Trump Organization he was a valued dealmaker, but to others (and eventually to Trump himself publicly) he was a liability to be minimized. Despite the Trump Organization’s attempts to erase or belittle Sater’s role, multiple points in the network trace back to him. Notably, **Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump** worked directly with Sater on Trump SoHo and traveled with him in Moscow ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Trump%27s%20children%20also%20began%20playing,Business%20Insider)), forging their own relationships with people Sater knew. Sater’s network also overlaps with figures like **Michael Cohen** (Trump’s lawyer), who was a childhood acquaintance of Sater from Brooklyn ([Felix Sater | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/felix-sater#:~:text=Sater%20moved%20to%20Brooklyn%2C%20NY,and%20Trump%20Organization%20vice%20president)). This meant that even as Trump distanced himself, other lieutenants (Cohen, etc.) could carry on interactions via Sater. 

In the broader context of Russian influence, Sater’s presence in Trump’s sphere was a **force-multiplier** for Moscow’s potential leverage. As one veteran journalist observed, Sater had the connections to “**get Putin on board**” with a Trump project, a claim he indeed made in 2015 ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=had%20reportedly%20worked%20for%20Semion,Trump%27s%20Business%20%E2%80%93%20Foreign%20Policy)). U.S. intelligence and congressional inquiries later suggested that figures like Sater could have been channels through which Russian interests courted Trump over the years ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=By%20the%20end%20of%20our,based%20on%20mutual%20financial%20interests)). Former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell even labeled Trump an “unwitting agent” of Russia, citing business links and flattery from people in Trump’s orbit ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Former%20CIA%20Deputy%20Director%20Michael,driven%20vulnerabilities)). Sater is precisely such a person – he flattered Trump with visions of grand deals and facilitated interactions with Kremlin-connected players, arguably aligning Trump’s financial interests with Russia’s. 

In summary, Felix Sater’s broader role was to **interconnect disparate elements** of Trump’s world (business partners, family, lawyers) with Russian and underworld counterparts. He was a central node through which money flowed (often opaquely) and through which messages and proposals were exchanged between Team Trump and Russian allies. Without Sater, Trump’s deepening entanglement with post-Soviet interests in the 2000s would likely have been far less extensive. Every network map of Trump’s Russia ties has Sater near the center, linking Trump Tower to the Kremlin, the mob, and beyond.

## Tamir Sapir

### Background & Biography
Tamir Sapir (born Temur Sepiashvili in 1946) was a Georgian-born American real estate magnate and billionaire. Sapir’s personal story was a classic rags-to-riches tale with a post-Soviet twist. He emigrated from the Georgian SSR to New York in the 1970s, initially working as a cab driver in Manhattan ([Celebrity Living: Tamir Sapir - Haute Living](https://hauteliving.com/2008/01/celebrity-living-tamir-sapir/2039/#:~:text=Celebrity%20Living%3A%20Tamir%20Sapir%20,catered%20primarily%20to%20Russian)). Spotting an opportunity in the influx of Soviet immigrants and traders, Sapir saved enough money to open an electronics store that catered primarily to Russian clientele ([Celebrity Living: Tamir Sapir - Haute Living](https://hauteliving.com/2008/01/celebrity-living-tamir-sapir/2039/#:~:text=Celebrity%20Living%3A%20Tamir%20Sapir%20,catered%20primarily%20to%20Russian)). Through this business, he befriended Soviet officials and businessmen, which proved lucrative: in the 1980s, Sapir (along with his business partner Sam Kislin) became a commodities broker trading fertilizer and oil with the Soviet Union ([The Happy-Go-Lucky Jewish Group That Connects Trump and Putin - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/the-happy-go-lucky-jewish-group-that-connects-trump-and-putin-215007/#:~:text=The%20Happy,Sater%20and%20Tamir%20Sapir%E2%80%94who)). These USSR trade deals netted Sapir a huge fortune by the early 1990s. He parlayed that wealth into New York real estate, founding the Sapir Organization. By the 2000s, the Sapir Organization owned millions of square feet of prime Manhattan property ([Sapir means Empire - Haute Living](https://hauteliving.com/2007/07/sapir-means-empire/476/#:~:text=Sapir%20means%20Empire%20,which%20together%20make%20up)). Forbes listed Sapir as a billionaire, and he gained a reputation for lavish spending (famously amassing a collection of Fabergé eggs and a $40 million Fifth Avenue townhouse) ([The Prospecting Professor: "It's not easy being a billionaire."](https://prospectingprofessor.blogs.com/prospecting_professor/2006/01/its_not_easy_be.html#:~:text=The%20Prospecting%20Professor%3A%20,colorful)).

Sapir’s background also had shadows of criminal and intelligence connections, though he himself was never charged with wrongdoing. His early partner Sam Kislin was investigated by the FBI in the late 1990s for allegedly laundering money for Russian mobsters (no charges were filed) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=The%20partnership%20between%20Trump%20and,profile%20projects.%20Throughout%20this)). Sapir moved in circles that included Soviet expatriates and *members of Russian organized crime groups*, according to later congressional testimony by Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS ([Suspicious Travel, Money Laundering, and Mafia Ties](https://investigaterussia.org/media/2018-01-19/suspicious-travel-money-laundering-and-mafia-ties#:~:text=Suspicious%20Travel%2C%20Money%20Laundering%2C%20and,the%20first%20things%20we%20found)). Additionally, Sapir maintained ties in his native Georgia and in Moscow; his ability to secure Soviet-era export contracts hints at possible cooperation with Soviet intelligence or influential figures (which was common for businessmen in that era). While much of this is speculative, it’s clear Sapir was deeply embedded in the post-Soviet expatriate community that straddled legitimate business and underground economies.

### Interactions with Donald Trump
Tamir Sapir’s most significant interaction with Donald Trump was as Trump’s **business partner in the Trump SoHo project**. The two likely met in New York real estate circles in the early 2000s, as both were prominent figures (Trump as a developer/celebrity and Sapir as a major landlord). In 2006, Sapir joined forces with Trump and Bayrock Group to develop **Trump SoHo**, a luxury condo-hotel in downtown Manhattan ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=Their%20most%20high%20profile%20project,share)). Sapir’s role was primarily as a financial backer through his Sapir Organization, bringing in capital and property assets. At the project’s launch in 2007, Sapir stood beside Trump, Felix Sater, and Tevfik Arif on stage – a visible symbol of their partnership ([Trump’s Soviet pimp crime partner Arif a major donor to Chabad | Fitzpatrick Informer](https://fitzinfo.net/2021/03/07/trumps-soviet-pimp-crime-partner-arif-a-major-donor-to-chabad/)). Trump publicly acknowledged Sapir’s involvement; for instance, at the SoHo groundbreaking, Trump praised his “friend Tamir” as a great success story of immigrating from the Soviet Union to riches in America (as reported by attendees).

Beyond Trump SoHo, Sapir and Trump had earlier real estate dealings. In 2004, Sapir sold an aging office building at 11 West 42nd Street in Manhattan to the Trump Organization (Trump converted it into the Trump Tower International Hotel and Tower) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=The%20partnership%20between%20Trump%20and,profile%20projects.%20Throughout%20this)). This transaction may have laid the groundwork for their later partnership. Additionally, their families had connections: Tamir’s son, Alex Sapir, and daughter Zina Sapir were involved in the family business and interacted with the Trump children. In fact, **Alex Sapir and his brother-in-law Rotem Rosen** accompanied Trump on a 2013 trip to Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant, showing how the Sapir-Trump relationship extended into Trump’s Russia ventures as well ([Trump’s Soviet pimp crime partner Arif a major donor to Chabad | Fitzpatrick Informer](https://fitzinfo.net/2021/03/07/trumps-soviet-pimp-crime-partner-arif-a-major-donor-to-chabad/#:~:text=After%20his%20arrest%20on%20Arif%E2%80%99s,Russian%20Center%20of%20South%20Florida)). That Moscow trip (for which Aras Agalarov was host) came after Tamir Sapir’s death, but it demonstrates the continuity of the Sapir-Trump link via the next generation.

Trump SoHo remained the signature joint venture between Sapir and Trump. When the project opened in 2010, it initially garnered buzz, but soon sales problems and legal troubles emerged (as noted earlier). Sapir was named as a co-defendant alongside Trump and Bayrock in the 2011 buyer fraud lawsuits (since his firm co-developed the property) ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=yacht%20called%20the%20Savarona,court%20acquitted%20him%20in%202012)). Those suits were settled in 2011 with refunds to buyers ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=In%20November%202011%2C%20Trump%20SoHo,Arif%20reportedly%20moved%20to%20Turkey)). Despite these issues, Trump and Sapir’s partnership stood as one of the clearest instances of Trump directly partnering with a **former Soviet Union émigré tycoon**. Sapir passed away in September 2014, marking the end of his personal involvement. However, his son Alex continued to run Sapir Org and maintained ties with the Trump Organization thereafter.

### Financial, Criminal, or Political Connections
Tamir Sapir’s financial connections were extensive, straddling the U.S. and the former USSR. Financially, Sapir exemplified the influx of **post-Soviet wealth into U.S. real estate**. He quietly provided funding and property for Trump SoHo (exact figures are private, but Sapir contributed valuable Manhattan land and capital). His fortune originated from deals with the Soviet government – a fact that in hindsight raises questions about whether any Soviet-era entities (perhaps even intelligence-linked) benefited from or guided his success. Indeed, a **Politico investigation** noted that Trump’s partnership with Bayrock-Sapir (Arif, Sater, Sapir) connected him to a “**happy-go-lucky Jewish group**” of Soviet émigrés who had an uncanny knack for attracting Russian money ([The Happy-Go-Lucky Jewish Group That Connects Trump and Putin - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/the-happy-go-lucky-jewish-group-that-connects-trump-and-putin-215007/#:~:text=The%20Happy,Sater%20and%20Tamir%20Sapir%E2%80%94who)).

Criminally, while Sapir had no criminal convictions or charges, his milieu was not free of controversy. His aforementioned partner Sam Kislin was named in a 1999 FBI report regarding Russian OC (organized crime) money laundering ([Suspicious Travel, Money Laundering, and Mafia Ties](https://investigaterussia.org/media/2018-01-19/suspicious-travel-money-laundering-and-mafia-ties#:~:text=Free%20Beacon%2C%20you%20had%20mentioned,the%20first%20things%20we%20found)). Sapir’s name also came up in the **Mueller investigation context**: Fusion GPS’s Glenn Simpson testified that Sapir’s businesses had associations with Russian crime figures, which, if true, means law enforcement likely took note ([Suspicious Travel, Money Laundering, and Mafia Ties](https://investigaterussia.org/media/2018-01-19/suspicious-travel-money-laundering-and-mafia-ties#:~:text=Suspicious%20Travel%2C%20Money%20Laundering%2C%20and,the%20first%20things%20we%20found)). However, there is no public record of Sapir being directly implicated in any crime. It’s possible his wealth shielded him and he operated in a gray area of semi-legal commerce typical of the wild 1990s post-Soviet market.

Politically, Sapir was not a major political donor or actor in the U.S., but he had notable connections. In Russia and Georgia, he was friendly with power brokers. Unconfirmed reports suggested he had relationships with Georgian politicians (owing to his heritage) and Russian officials (owing to his commodities trading days). In the U.S., Sapir curried favor with figures like Rudy Giuliani (Kislin and Sapir donated to Giuliani’s mayoral campaigns in the 1990s) ([The Happy-Go-Lucky Jewish Group That Connects Trump and Putin - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/the-happy-go-lucky-jewish-group-that-connects-trump-and-putin-215007/#:~:text=The%20Happy,Sater%20and%20Tamir%20Sapir%E2%80%94who)). This hints at a lobbying aspect – Sapir ingratiating himself with New York power structures. Additionally, Sapir’s daughter Zina married Rotem Rosen, a real estate investor who was a protégé of Israeli-Russian diamond mogul Lev Leviev (Leviev is closely connected to Vladimir Putin). This marriage further entwined Sapir with international elites, including those tied to the Kremlin. Such links are indirect but suggest that through family and business, Sapir was only a degree or two removed from some **formidable networks** (Russian oligarchs, Israeli billionaires, New York politicians).

### Broader Role in the Network
Tamir Sapir’s role in Trump’s broader network was to serve as a **channel for Soviet/post-Soviet capital and connections into Trump’s developments**. He was part of the triad – along with Arif and Sater – that brought Trump SoHo to fruition, effectively making Trump a business partner with Soviet-born financiers. In the bigger picture, Sapir’s involvement signaled to other wealthy Russians or CIS (former Soviet) investors that Trump ventures were open for business with them. Indeed, **numerous condo buyers at Trump SoHo and other Trump projects came from Russia and Kazakhstan**, which may have been facilitated by contacts from the Sapir/Bayrock orbit ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=President%20Vladimir%20V,forward%20as%20a%20racketeering%20case)). Sapir’s own background (enriching himself via USSR trade) embodied the merging of Soviet and American business interests that became a theme in Trump’s circle.

Sapir also acted as a **network node connecting Trump to a younger generation of international dealmakers**. His son Alex Sapir and son-in-law Rotem Rosen became good friends with the Trump family. Alex Sapir worked with Ivanka and Eric Trump during Trump SoHo, and Rosen was noted to be at Trump’s side during some 2013 Moscow meetings ([Trump’s Soviet pimp crime partner Arif a major donor to Chabad | Fitzpatrick Informer](https://fitzinfo.net/2021/03/07/trumps-soviet-pimp-crime-partner-arif-a-major-donor-to-chabad/#:~:text=After%20his%20arrest%20on%20Arif%E2%80%99s,Russian%20Center%20of%20South%20Florida)). Through these relationships, the “Sapir network” persisted around Trump even after Tamir’s death. For example, Rosen reportedly attended the Miss Universe Moscow after-parties and had contacts with figures like Aras Agalarov, reinforcing ties between Trump’s camp and Putin-adjacent oligarchs. In that sense, Sapir’s network helped knit together different factions: Soviet-born Jews in New York, Russian oligarchs, and the Trump business empire.

In the context of potential foreign influence, Sapir is an example of how **legitimate business partnerships can create pathways for less scrupulous actors**. By partnering with Sapir, Trump indirectly came into proximity with Sapir’s friends and associates – some of whom had checkered reputations. This underscores why investigators later examined Trump SoHo and the Bayrock-Sapir partnership for money laundering or covert influence ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=President%20Vladimir%20V,forward%20as%20a%20racketeering%20case)). Tamir Sapir’s legacy in the Trump saga is that of a *connector* – he connected East and West, old Soviet money with new Trump projects. His presence in Trump’s network during 2001–2014 significantly widened the circle of foreign figures who gained a stake, financially or personally, in Trump’s success.

## Roman Abramovich

### Background & Biography
Roman Abramovich is one of Russia’s most well-known oligarchs – a billionaire businessman with close ties to the Kremlin. Born in 1966 in Saratov, Russia, Abramovich rose from modest origins to immense wealth during the **1990s post-Soviet privatization** era. He made his first fortune trading commodities like oil and gas, eventually becoming a protege of Boris Berezovsky and acquiring significant stakes in Sibneft (a major Russian oil company) in the mid-1990s ([Abramovich and Zhukova — Russia’s Most High Profile Split](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2017/08/08/abramovich-zhukova-russias-most-high-profile-split-explained-a58600#:~:text=Abramovich%20and%20Zhukova%20%E2%80%94%20Russia%E2%80%99s,Dasha%20Zhukova%20announced%20on)). By the early 2000s, Abramovich was among the richest men in Russia. He was also politically active: from 2001 to 2008, he served as the Governor of Chukotka, a remote Russian Far East region, reportedly at Vladimir Putin’s behest as a form of public service and influence balancing ([Abramovich and Zhukova — Russia’s Most High Profile Split](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2017/08/08/abramovich-zhukova-russias-most-high-profile-split-explained-a58600#:~:text=Abramovich%20and%20Zhukova%20%E2%80%94%20Russia%E2%80%99s,Dasha%20Zhukova%20announced%20on)). Globally, Abramovich is famous for his ownership of the English football club **Chelsea F.C.**, which he purchased in 2003, and for his high-profile lifestyle (mega-yachts, art collections, etc.). 

Crucially, Abramovich is widely regarded as a **Kremlin insider**. He was a trusted ally of President Putin; a 2018 U.S. Treasury list even identified Abramovich as one of the Russian oligarchs closest to Putin’s government ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=more%20about%20moving%20money%20than,Trump%27s%20Business%20%E2%80%93%20Foreign%20Policy)). While not known to be involved in organized crime, he has faced legal disputes – for example, a huge 2012 lawsuit in London filed by Berezovsky (which Abramovich won) shed light on the murky deals of the 1990s. Abramovich’s wealth has at times drawn scrutiny from Western governments. (He was not sanctioned in the U.S. during 2001–2014, but later, in 2018 and 2022, the U.K. and others sanctioned him for his ties to Putin.) By 2014, Abramovich’s net worth was well over $8 billion, and he was an influential figure straddling business and politics in Russia.

### Interactions with Donald Trump
Despite Roman Abramovich’s prominence, his **direct interactions with Donald Trump were limited**. There is no public record of business deals or meetings between Abramovich and Trump in the 2001–2014 period. However, Abramovich intersected Trump’s world indirectly through real estate and social connections. Notably, in **2003**, Abramovich’s then-wife, **Dasha Zhukova**, purchased a luxury condo in the Trump World Tower in Manhattan ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Among%20these%20purchasers%20was%20Roman,he%20rebuilt%20his%20business%20empire)). This condo purchase – reportedly arranged by a broker (likely Dolly Lenz) – signified that Abramovich’s family was parking some money in a Trump property. While the dollar amount was not huge for Abramovich (the unit was one of many high-end condos he owned internationally), it provided Trump with much-needed sales during a period when attracting wealthy buyers was critical ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Among%20these%20purchasers%20was%20Roman,he%20rebuilt%20his%20business%20empire)). 

More significantly, by the early 2010s, **Ivanka Trump developed a friendship with Abramovich’s wife, Dasha Zhukova**. Ivanka and Jared Kushner socialized with Abramovich and Zhukova in socialite circles. In 2014, the Kushners spent several days in Russia as Zhukova’s guests, even sitting at Abramovich’s table during a gala, according to media reports ([Roman Abramovich: billionaire oligarch, Chelsea owner, Kremlin ally ...](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/russia-central-asia/article/2107335/roman-abramovich-billionaire-oligarch-chelsea-owner#:~:text=,powered)). This personal relationship led to Zhukova attending Donald Trump’s 2017 inauguration as Ivanka’s invited guest ([Did Ivanka Trump And Jared Kushner Meet A Putin-Connected Russian Oligarch In Aspen? | IBTimes](https://www.ibtimes.com/did-ivanka-trump-jared-kushner-meet-putin-connected-russian-oligarch-aspen-2515668#:~:text=Abramovich%20has%20ties%20to%20the,at%20the%20first%20daughter%27s%20request)). While these events are just outside the 2001–2014 window, they stem from connections formed during that period. It’s known that Ivanka and Jared visited Abramovich on his yacht and in Moscow socially – interactions likely initiated through Dasha Zhukova’s friendship. Thus, by proxy, Trump’s family had direct contact with Abramovich.

From a business perspective, the most talked-about link is **Abramovich’s role as a buyer in Trump properties**. Apart from the 2003 Trump World Tower condo, Abramovich’s name surfaced as a potential buyer of other Trump assets (mostly rumors – for instance, speculation in 2008 that he was behind some Florida purchases, which wasn’t substantiated). There’s also a famous coincidence: during the 2016 campaign, Abramovich’s private jet and Trump’s jet were observed at the same airports several times, fueling conjecture of meetings ([Did Ivanka Trump And Jared Kushner Meet A Putin-Connected Russian ...](https://www.ibtimes.com/did-ivanka-trump-jared-kushner-meet-putin-connected-russian-oligarch-aspen-2515668#:~:text=Did%20Ivanka%20Trump%20And%20Jared,is%20an%20art%20collector)). No concrete evidence of a meeting in that time exists, but it exemplifies the intrigue around Abramovich as someone who *could* reach Trump if needed.

In summary, Abramovich’s interactions with Trump were **indirect but notable**: through real estate purchases by his family and through the personal camaraderie between his wife and Trump’s daughter. There is no indication that Abramovich and Trump negotiated deals or politics one-on-one prior to 2014. However, Abramovich’s proximity to Trump’s inner circle (via Ivanka) positioned him uniquely should he have wanted to exercise influence or deliver messages from the Kremlin down the line.

### Financial, Criminal, or Political Connections
Roman Abramovich’s financial and political connections are extensive and high-powered. Financially, as an oligarch, he had vast resources to deploy. His purchase of the Trump World Tower condo (reportedly around $5 million) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Among%20these%20purchasers%20was%20Roman,he%20rebuilt%20his%20business%20empire)) was a drop in the bucket for him, but it exemplified how Russian elites diversified wealth into Western assets. Such purchases can carry money-laundering concerns, but in Abramovich’s case the purchase was open (in his wife’s name) and not illegal. Abramovich’s broader finances have been scrutinized: he is thought to have benefited from sweetheart deals in the privatization of Sibneft and Rusal (an aluminum giant), likely with Kremlin blessing. He’s also known for huge investments in the West (like Chelsea F.C. and luxury real estate in the UK and U.S.), making him a leading figure in the outflow of Russian capital.

Criminal connections: Abramovich has not been convicted or directly implicated in organized crime. However, the **nature of Russian oligarchy** blurs lines – he maintained good relations with mob-linked figures like the **Izmaylovskaya gang** in Moscow for business security, as alleged in some reports, though evidence is sparse. More clearly, Abramovich has faced legal entanglements: the 2012 London court case where Berezovsky accused him of coercion and contract violations (Abramovich won, but the case revealed how he paid huge sums in politically motivated deals) ([Abramovich and Zhukova — Russia’s Most High Profile Split](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2017/08/08/abramovich-zhukova-russias-most-high-profile-split-explained-a58600#:~:text=Abramovich%20and%20Zhukova%20%E2%80%94%20Russia%E2%80%99s,Dasha%20Zhukova%20announced%20on)). In Russia, he’s had to navigate the thin line of Putin’s patronage, which arguably forced him to spend billions on public projects (like infrastructure in Chukotka and the 2014 Sochi Olympics) in exchange for staying in the Kremlin’s good graces.

Politically, Abramovich is **deeply connected**. He was a member of Russia’s parliament (State Duma) briefly and a regional governor. He received personal thanks from Putin for his service (Putin awarded him an Order of Honor). U.S. diplomatic cables (per WikiLeaks) described Abramovich as “the man Putin turns to when he needs something done quietly” – underscoring his role as a trusted fixer/financier for the Kremlin. Internationally, Abramovich built connections in Israel (he obtained Israeli citizenship in 2018) and with Western elites (he donated to prominent cultural institutions, possibly to build soft influence). In the context of Trump’s world, Abramovich’s political significance lies in his status as **Putin’s ally**. Any intersection between Abramovich and Trump’s sphere was likely of keen interest to intelligence services. Indeed, when Dasha Zhukova attended the 2017 inaugural festivities, observers noted that “the wife of one of Putin’s closest friends” was present ([Did Ivanka Trump And Jared Kushner Meet A Putin-Connected Russian Oligarch In Aspen? | IBTimes](https://www.ibtimes.com/did-ivanka-trump-jared-kushner-meet-putin-connected-russian-oligarch-aspen-2515668#:~:text=Abramovich%20has%20ties%20to%20the,at%20the%20first%20daughter%27s%20request)), highlighting security concerns.

### Broader Role in the Network
Roman Abramovich’s broader role in Trump’s network is that of a **high-level outlier** – he was not part of Trump’s circle, but his wealth and Kremlin ties made him a person of interest on the periphery. In the ecosystem of Trump’s Russia connections, Abramovich represents the **top-tier Russian oligarch** class. His indirect links to Trump (through purchases and family friendships) suggest that even the most powerful Russian figures found their way, however subtly, into Trump’s orbit. This speaks to the attractiveness of Trump’s assets to foreign money and the openness of Trump’s circle to cultivating relationships with influential Russians.

Abramovich also serves as a case study in how Russian state-connected capital interacted with Trump’s business. Unlike many shady characters who bought Trump condos anonymously, Abramovich did so openly and was a legitimate, government-aligned billionaire. His involvement lent an air of normalcy (“if someone as prominent as Abramovich trusts Trump properties, they must be fine”), potentially encouraging other wealthy Russians to follow. It’s notable that at Trump World Tower in the early 2000s, dozens of Russians bought units ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Among%20these%20purchasers%20was%20Roman,he%20rebuilt%20his%20business%20empire)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=As%20the%20U,100%20million%20in%20Trump%20buildings)) – Abramovich’s family purchase was among the most prominent of those, possibly inspiring confidence in others.

Within any “network map” of Trump-Russia ties, Abramovich would sit on the fringe, connected via Dasha Zhukova to Ivanka Trump, and via that 2003 condo to Trump’s real estate pipeline. There’s evidence that information flowed through these channels: Ivanka and Dasha’s friendship meant that by 2015–2016, Abramovich likely had insight into Trump’s ambitions, and conversely, the Trumps had a personal connection to someone in Putin’s inner circle. While Abramovich did not play an active role in any Trump dealmaking, the **potential for influence or communication was there**. In 2016, for instance, Abramovich’s close friend **Ara Abramyan** (a Russian-Armenian businessman) reportedly conveyed messages between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign – speculation that underscores how people one handshake away (as Abramovich was) could be intermediaries.

In summary, Roman Abramovich’s presence in the Trump saga underscores the **breadth of Trump’s Russian entanglements**: not just mid-level ex-Soviets buying condos, but even Putin’s confidants were tangentially involved. His role was largely passive, but his very connection to Trump’s family and property provided another thread by which Russia’s elite were woven into Trump’s world. This would later fuel concerns that **Trump had extensive ties to Putin’s circle** beyond what was initially apparent.

## Donald Trump Jr.

### Background & Biography
Donald Trump Jr., born in 1977, is the eldest son of Donald J. Trump. In the 2001–2014 period, Trump Jr. was being groomed as an heir to the Trump business and took on increasing responsibilities within the Trump Organization. He graduated from the Wharton School in 2000 and soon after joined his father’s company, initially handling projects in the United States. As the Trump Organization pivoted to international deals and licensing in the 2000s, Don Jr. emerged as an integral deal-maker, often traveling abroad to scout opportunities and network with potential partners ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Trump%27s%20children%20also%20began%20playing,Business%20Insider)). He developed a reputation as more low-key and approachable than his father, which served him well in cultivating relationships with developers overseas.

Donald Jr. has no known criminal record or direct involvement in illicit networks. However, he has always been an avid hunter and outdoorsman, and interestingly, those hobbies took him to destinations like Russia – providing informal networking chances. Fluent in Czech (from his mother Ivana’s side), he also had a personal appreciation for Eastern Europe. Throughout the 2000s, he and his siblings Ivanka and Eric formed the public face of the next Trump generation, speaking at real estate conferences and promoting Trump properties worldwide. By 2014, Donald Jr. was an Executive Vice President at the Trump Organization and a key conduit between his father and many foreign business contacts.

### Interactions with Donald Trump (and Russian Dealings)
In the context of Russian entanglements, **Donald Trump Jr. played a proactive role in pursuing deals in Russia and wooing Russian investors**. Along with Ivanka, he traveled to Moscow multiple times in the mid-2000s seeking development projects ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Trump%27s%20children%20also%20began%20playing,Business%20Insider)). For example, in 2006 Don Jr. and Ivanka visited Russia on a trip arranged by Bayrock’s Felix Sater, during which they toured potential sites and even visited the Kremlin ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Trump%27s%20children%20also%20began%20playing,Business%20Insider)). These trips were part of the Trump Organization’s efforts to launch a Trump Tower Moscow or similar venture. Don Jr. later reflected that he had been to Russia “half a dozen times” in those years, learning the market and building connections ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Trump%27s%20children%20also%20began%20playing,Business%20Insider)).

On the domestic side, Donald Jr. was deeply involved in selling Trump properties to foreign buyers. He helped market condos in developments like Trump World Tower, Trump SoHo, and Trump’s projects in Sunny Isles Beach, Florida – all of which saw significant interest from Russian and former Soviet buyers ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=direct%20cultivation,The%20Moscow%20Project)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=As%20the%20U,100%20million%20in%20Trump%20buildings)). He cultivated relationships with brokers like Dolly Lenz and international clients. In fact, Don Jr. became notably candid about the importance of Russian money. In **September 2008**, speaking at a real estate conference, he famously said: **“Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.”** ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=In%20September%202008%2C%20at%20the,the%20Trump%20Organization%27s%20business%20model)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=,the%20Trump%20Organization%27s%20business%20model)). This remark (widely quoted later) confirmed that he was well aware of – and actively courting – Russian investment in Trump projects.

During 2008–2009, when the U.S. financial crisis hit, Donald Jr. and his brother Eric turned to overseas funding sources to keep projects afloat. According to an anecdote by a golf journalist, in 2014 Don Jr. and Eric mentioned that the Trump Organization wasn’t relying on American banks but had access to capital from Russia ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=In%20a%20similar%20vein%2C%20Eric,Trump%20ventures%20during%20this%20period)). (Eric allegedly said “we have all the funding we need out of Russia,” a statement he later denied, but which aligns with Don Jr.’s 2008 admission ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=In%20a%20similar%20vein%2C%20Eric,Trump%20ventures%20during%20this%20period)).) These interactions illustrate that Don Jr. was directly involved in discussions and decisions to tap Russian capital when U.S. financing dried up.

Beyond business, Donald Jr. interacted socially with individuals from the former Soviet Union who orbited his father. For instance, at the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, Don Jr. was present and mingled with the Agalarov family and their circle. He later followed up on the Agalarovs’ interest in a Trump Moscow tower, leading negotiations on the Trump Organization side in late 2013 and 2014 ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Throughout%20his%20Moscow%20visit%2C%20Trump,Wikipedia)). Although that specific project stalled by 2014, Don Jr. remained a primary point of contact for Russian partners until the political climate shifted.

### Financial, Criminal, or Political Connections
Donald Trump Jr.’s financial connections to Russian-linked figures were a byproduct of his role in the Trump Organization. He did not independently seek outside investments, but as he managed projects, he engaged with many financiers and buyers from Russia/CIS. For example, he would have been aware of and possibly met buyers like **Dmitry Rybolovlev** (who in 2008 purchased Trump’s Palm Beach estate for $95 million) – though that sale was handled by his father, Don Jr. undoubtedly understood its importance ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=empire%2C%20but%20it%20also%20coincided,Money%20Helped%20Save%20Trump%27s%20Business)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=transactions%20involving%20a%20Russian%20buyer,Russian%20Money%20Helped%20Save%20Trump%27s)). He was also likely involved in courting **Kazakh investors** for Trump SoHo (court filings showed Trump Jr. signed off on the deal involving funds from Kazakhstan via Iceland’s FL Group) ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=In%202007%2C%20Bayrock%20secured%20%2450,In%20December%202016%2C%20a%20New)).

Criminally, Don Jr. found himself tangentially connected to investigations later on. The 2011 Manhattan D.A. probe into Trump SoHo examined whether Don Jr. and Ivanka made misrepresentations to buyers about sales figures ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=By%202011%2C%20the%20project%20faced,Business)). Emails suggested they knew the condo sales were lagging but still promoted rosy numbers. In the end, no criminal charges were filed; the matter was settled civilly ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=By%202011%2C%20the%20project%20faced,Business)). This incident shows Don Jr. operating in legally gray promotional practices. Additionally, when Jody Kriss alleged Bayrock was laundering money, Trump Jr. was named in the context of having **knowledge of certain financing arrangements** (he signed some documents for the FL Group deal) ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=President%20Vladimir%20V,forward%20as%20a%20racketeering%20case)), though he was not a defendant. Thus, he was adjacent to potential financial misconduct, even if not accused of wrongdoing himself.

Politically, during 2001–2014 Don Jr. wasn’t a political figure. However, his actions had political ramifications. His openness about Russian money became a point of political contention in 2016–2017 when Trump’s Russia ties were scrutinized. Internally, his role connecting with Russians set the stage for later events – most notably the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer, which Don Jr. agreed to after being told it was on behalf of the “Russian government’s support” for his father. That event is beyond our timeframe, but its roots lie in relationships formed earlier (the outreach came via the Agalarovs, whom Don Jr. knew from 2013). 

In summary, Donald Trump Jr.’s connections to Russian finance were extensive in a business sense. He **actively courted Russian money** to sustain the Trump empire, effectively functioning as a key interlocutor for Russian investors. While not himself tied to criminal networks, he swam in waters that included money laundering risks and became a person of interest in political investigations by virtue of his interactions with Kremlin-linked individuals.

### Broader Role in the Network
Donald Trump Jr. was a **driving force in integrating Russian and post-Soviet figures into Trump’s network**. In the early 2000s, he realized the strategic value of that capital and pursued it aggressively. This had the long-term effect of making the Trump Organization increasingly reliant on and intertwined with foreign funds. Don Jr.’s 2008 statement that Russian money was “pouring in” ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=,the%20Trump%20Organization%27s%20business%20model)) is seen as a candid acknowledgement that by then, Trump’s business model had shifted toward those sources. His role can be viewed as that of a **facilitator and gatekeeper**: he facilitated investments from Russia and served as a gatekeeper for foreign partners trying to reach his father.

Within the Trump family, Donald Jr. often took point on deals in **emerging or risky markets** (Russia, ex-Soviet republics, Latin America). Thus, he built a Rolodex of contacts ranging from oligarchs to provincial businessmen. For instance, he cultivated a relationship with the **Silk Road Group in Georgia** (for a Trump Tower in Batumi, Georgia around 2011) – another deal involving post-Soviet money. The pattern shows Don Jr. consistently engaging with the very types of actors – wealthy, often opaque-money individuals – who would later be of interest to intelligence services. In effect, he broadened Trump’s associate network to include many more Russians, Kazakhs, Azeris, Georgians, etc., laying the groundwork for what one analyst called an “**unwitting agent**” scenario where Trump’s business loyalties could be leveraged by foreign interests ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Former%20CIA%20Deputy%20Director%20Michael,driven%20vulnerabilities)).

In the broader Trump-Russia narrative, Donald Jr. is sometimes described as having a **blind spot** – eagerly doing business with people close to foreign governments without apparent concern for geopolitical implications. His enthusiastic response to offers of “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in 2016 (“I love it”) is consistent with the persona of someone who, for years prior, saw Russian associates as friends and benefactors, not adversaries. During 2001–2014, this stance helped embed Russian interests into Trump enterprises. By 2014, Don Jr. had helped his father establish a “complex network of business ties to Russia that far exceeded those of typical American real estate developers” ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=During%20these%20years%2C%20several%20key,These%20connections)). Therefore, his broader role was crucial: he was one of the architects of Trump’s Russia-facing business strategy, directly influencing how deeply the Trump Organization enmeshed itself with post-Soviet money.

## Ivanka Trump

### Background & Biography
Ivanka Trump, born in 1981, is Donald Trump’s daughter from his first marriage (to Ivana Trump). During 2001–2014, Ivanka evolved from a socialite and model into a polished business executive within the Trump Organization. After graduating from Wharton in 2004, she joined the family business and quickly became a public face of Trump real estate, often working side by side with her father and brothers. Ivanka had a keen interest in design and branding; she launched a jewelry and fashion line even as she took on development projects. By the late 2000s, she was involved in all major Trump ventures, from Trump SoHo in New York to international hotel deals, and frequently spoke for the company in media.

Ivanka’s public image was that of the savvy, sophisticated Trump heir, and she largely avoided controversy in that era. She did not have any criminal associations. In fact, if anything, she brought a sheen of legitimacy to projects. However, like her brothers, Ivanka’s activities drew scrutiny later – for example, the Manhattan D.A. looked into whether she and Don Jr. misled Trump SoHo condo buyers (the case was dropped after a settlement) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=By%202011%2C%20the%20project%20faced,Business)). Politically, Ivanka wasn’t active pre-2014 apart from attending events and donating modestly to candidates of both parties. Her marriage in 2009 to Jared Kushner, scion of a powerful real estate family, further expanded her network in business and political circles.

### Interactions with Donald Trump (and Russian Dealings)
Ivanka Trump was deeply involved in the Trump Organization’s push into foreign markets, including Russia and the former Soviet states. Along with Donald Jr., she traveled to Moscow in pursuit of Trump-branded projects. On a 2006 Moscow trip, famously arranged by Bayrock’s Felix Sater, Sater took Ivanka on a tour of the Kremlin ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=opportunities,Business%20Insider)). In a colorful anecdote, Sater later boasted that he seated Ivanka in President Putin’s private office chair during this visit ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=opportunities,Business%20Insider)). Ivanka herself confirmed that she’d been to Russia “half a dozen times” by 2008 in search of deals ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Trump%27s%20children%20also%20began%20playing,Ivanka%20to%20Sit%20in%20Putins)). These trips indicate she met with potential partners and government figures. For example, Ivanka scouted sites for a Trump International hotel in Moscow and looked at a Moscow golf resort opportunity around 2006 ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Trump%27s%20children%20also%20began%20playing,Business%20Insider)).

At home, Ivanka played a major role in projects that attracted Russian money. She was a point person for **Trump SoHo**: she appeared at the 2007 launch with Arif and Sater ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Trump%20SoHo%20was%20the%20signature,the%20project%20opened%20in%202010)) and was involved in marketing the condos. Emails later revealed Ivanka and Don Jr. were aware the project was struggling to sell units, yet they still promoted it – which was part of the aforementioned fraud allegations (settled in 2011) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=By%202011%2C%20the%20project%20faced,Business)). Ivanka was also very active in the Trump Ocean Club in Panama and Trump projects in Toronto and Vancouver, all of which had significant foreign buyers/investors (some Russian or Ukrainian). For instance, in Toronto, Ivanka liaised with developer Alexander Shnaider (who had Russian ties via VEB bank funding) on design and marketing of the Trump International Hotel & Tower Toronto ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=There%20is%20evidence%20that%20Russian,Business%20Insider)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=state%20development%20bank%20whose%20supervisory,Business%20Insider)).

During the Miss Universe 2013 pageant in Moscow – which Ivanka did not attend – her influence was still felt. She had helped coordinate the pageant business aspects earlier in the year since Miss Universe was part of the Trump portfolio. Ivanka’s friendship with Dasha Zhukova (Roman Abramovich’s wife) is another notable interaction. By **2014**, Ivanka and Jared joined Dasha and Roman Abramovich on vacation in Russia ([Roman Abramovich: billionaire oligarch, Chelsea owner, Kremlin ally ...](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/russia-central-asia/article/2107335/roman-abramovich-billionaire-oligarch-chelsea-owner#:~:text=,powered)), reflecting a personal relationship. This friendship created a direct line between the Trump family and one of Putin’s inner-circle oligarch families. Ivanka inviting Dasha to the 2017 inauguration is evidence of how strong that bond became ([Did Ivanka Trump And Jared Kushner Meet A Putin-Connected Russian Oligarch In Aspen? | IBTimes](https://www.ibtimes.com/did-ivanka-trump-jared-kushner-meet-putin-connected-russian-oligarch-aspen-2515668#:~:text=Abramovich%20has%20ties%20to%20the,at%20the%20first%20daughter%27s%20request)) (though slightly outside our timeframe, it was built in the preceding years).

In summary, Ivanka interacted with Russians in both business and social realms: chasing real estate deals in Moscow, working with Soviet-born partners on U.S. projects, and befriending oligarch families. She was arguably **the most cosmopolitan Trump**, which made her a key asset in forging international relationships.

### Financial, Criminal, or Political Connections
Financially, Ivanka Trump was tied to Russian and post-Soviet interests through the deals she managed. She was aware of and involved in the financing structures of Trump projects that included Russian money. For example, Ivanka likely had knowledge of the **FL Group financing** for Trump SoHo (she was an executive on the project when Bayrock secured those funds linked to wealthy Russians) ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=In%202007%2C%20Bayrock%20secured%20%2450,In%20December%202016%2C%20a%20New)). She also dealt with **Vnesheconombank (VEB)** indirectly via the Toronto project – while Trump had no equity, Ivanka was the public face pitching the project to buyers, even as $15 million from a VEB-funded deal went into its construction ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=There%20is%20evidence%20that%20Russian,Business%20Insider)). This means she was in the orbit of a Russian state bank’s money (unwittingly or not).

Ivanka’s name surfaced in the 2017 investigations largely around the Trump Tower Moscow effort that started in 2015, but even in 2013–2014, she was corresponding with people like Emin Agalarov about possible developments. Politically, Ivanka had minimal direct engagement with Russia policy, but her *personal* connections (Abramovich/Zhukova) had political undertones because of Abramovich’s status. It is reported that **Abramovich’s role in Putin’s circle** made U.S. intelligence pay special attention to the Ivanka-Dasha friendship.

On the criminal front, aside from the Trump SoHo legal issues (which ended in settlement), Ivanka was not implicated in any wrongdoing. One interesting nugget: Felix Sater, who was on law enforcement’s radar, had an email in 2015 where he mentioned he got Ivanka to sit in Putin’s chair – something the Senate Intelligence Committee included, possibly to highlight a point of Russian *access* to the Trump family even in earlier years ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=opportunities,Business%20Insider)). That’s not a crime, but it’s the kind of detail that intelligence analysts note as an attempt by someone like Sater to ingratiate or potentially compromise (imagine if photos of Ivanka in Putin’s chair existed – a trivial but symbolic form of kompromat). 

Politically, Ivanka was very cautious in public statements about Russia pre-2014. She generally echoed her father’s business-friendly stance. After Putin’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, Ivanka did not comment (her father did, controversially). In private, one could surmise she and Jared’s interactions with people like Abramovich gave them a nuanced view of Russian elites – possibly seeing them as cosmopolitan peers rather than adversaries.

### Broader Role in the Network
Ivanka Trump’s broader role was as the **glamorous ambassador and integrator** of the Trump brand with foreign partners, including Russians. She lent credibility and a friendly face to would-be investors from Moscow to Almaty. Multiple sources noted that foreign buyers “all wanted to meet Ivanka” or Donald Sr. when buying Trump condos ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=assets.%20High,The%20Moscow%20Project)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=direct%20cultivation,The%20Moscow%20Project)). Ivanka’s presence was thus a selling point, solidifying relationships. For example, her interactions with Aras and Emin Agalarov in 2013 (dining with them in Vegas, discussing Miss Universe logistics) helped build trust that led to the Moscow pageant and discussions of a tower ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Trump%27s%20most%20significant%20business%20venture,POLITICO)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=In%20June%202013%2C%20Trump%20dined,Linked%20Transactions%20From%20the)).

Within Trump’s Russia network, Ivanka often bridged the gap between the **older generation (Trump, Arif, etc.) and the younger generation of oligarchs (Emin Agalarov, for instance)**. She spoke the language of luxury and branding that appealed to oligarchs’ wives and Western-educated children. This soft-power aspect of Ivanka’s role meant that the network of Trump associates wasn’t solely transactional – it also had social depth. Friendships like hers with Dasha Zhukova created informal channels of communication. It’s conceivable that through spouse conversations, messages could be relayed between the Trumps and Kremlin-linked circles in a friendly context (e.g., Dasha might mention what the mood in Moscow is, etc.). 

Ivanka also had influence on the strategic direction of the Trump Organization – she advocated for projects like Vancouver and Baku (Azerbaijan) which involved foreign capital from potentially controversial sources. In Azerbaijan’s case, the partner was the Mammadov family, suspected of corruption and links to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard (a deal that ultimately didn’t open). Though not Russia, it underscores her global deal-making that often intersected with murky finances, similar to deals in Russia. 

Overall, Ivanka’s role in the Trump-Russia story is often seen as less incriminating and more *enabling*. She enabled the cozy relationships and gave them a veneer of elegance. As one Trump Organization associate put it, having Ivanka in the room reassured investors and **smoothed over concerns** (even if behind the scenes the money might be questionable). By 2014, Ivanka had helped weave a tapestry of international contacts for the Trump Organization – many of which were in Russia or the former USSR – that would become highly significant once Trump ran for president and those ties drew intense scrutiny.

## Eric Trump

### Background & Biography
Eric Trump, born in 1984, is the third child of Donald Trump and Ivana Trump. In the 2001–2014 period, Eric was the junior member of the Trump adult children trio. After graduating from Georgetown University in 2006, he too joined the Trump Organization. Eric took on management roles in the company’s golf resort division and helped oversee construction projects. He was often in the shadow of Don Jr. and Ivanka in terms of public profile but nonetheless was involved in major deals. Known as the most low-profile Trump sibling, Eric focused on the operational side of projects and the expansion of Trump golf courses. He also started the Eric Trump Foundation, ostensibly for St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital (though later investigations raised questions about its practices, not Russia-related). 

Eric had no public political voice pre-2014 and stayed out of controversy for the most part. He did, however, echo the family line about the business. And as he grew into his role, he, like his siblings, traveled abroad to promote Trump ventures (e.g., to Scotland for golf, or to Central Asia for prospective deals).

### Interactions with Donald Trump (and Russian Dealings)
Eric Trump’s direct interactions with Russian individuals or deals were less documented than those of Don Jr. or Ivanka, but he was still part of the family strategy that sought Russian money. He was involved on the periphery of projects like **Trump SoHo** and Trump’s golf expansion during the late 2000s. It’s been reported that Eric was present in meetings with prospective investors, including those from Russia and Kazakhstan, though specifics are sparse. One often-cited anecdote came from journalist James Dodson: in 2014, while Eric and Don Jr. were golfing with Dodson, Eric allegedly said, “**We don’t rely on American banks. We have all the funding we need out of Russia**” ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=In%20a%20similar%20vein%2C%20Eric,Trump%20ventures%20during%20this%20period)). Eric later denied making that statement, but Dodson stood by his account. If true, it indicates Eric was well aware of the Trump Organization’s reliance on Russian capital during that era – and was frank about it in private.

Eric also played a key role in the Trump golf course in Turnberry, Scotland, which was purchased in 2014. While that deal was not directly Russian-related, how it was financed came under scrutiny (with questions about whether proceeds from the 2008 Rybolovlev mansion sale were used – essentially recycling Russian money). Eric oversaw the redevelopment of Turnberry, and British MP’s later raised concerns about large cash infusions from unknown sources. Again, no direct evidence ties that to Russia, but it shows the environment of opaque funding he was operating in.

During the height of Russian investment in Trump properties (2008–2012), Eric was in charge of several Trump condo projects’ sales teams. For example, he was involved in Trump International Hotel & Tower in Toronto’s marketing and might have interacted with agents of Alex Shnaider (who, as noted, got $850M from a Russian bank VEB, part of which flowed to that project) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=There%20is%20evidence%20that%20Russian,Business%20Insider)). Eric’s name doesn’t appear in correspondence like Don Jr.’s or Ivanka’s, which suggests he had a more background role. Still, being an executive, he certainly met and greeted many foreign buyers at events. He also joined Don Jr. in a 2006 trip to Kazakhstan to explore a Trump property in Astana (a trip that ultimately did not result in a project but connected them to Kazakh financiers reportedly) – a sign he wasn’t absent from the Russia/CIS outreach.

### Financial, Criminal, or Political Connections
Financially, Eric Trump benefited from the influx of Russian money by way of improved company balance sheets and successful property sales. The quote attributed to him about Russian funding ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=In%20a%20similar%20vein%2C%20Eric,Trump%20ventures%20during%20this%20period)) has been seen as an admission that Trump Org turned to Russian investors when U.S. banks said no – implying Eric was privy to those funding arrangements. In terms of specific connections, Eric likely knew people like **Oleg Misevra** or **Alexey Ustaev** only as names on condo sales contracts, if at all. But he would have been briefed that a large share of condo purchasers in certain projects were Russian, given that he was in charge of development budgets and sales absorption rates.

Criminal or intelligence flags around Eric Trump himself are minimal. His main brush with controversy came from an entirely separate matter – the Eric Trump Foundation’s handling of charity funds (which became an issue in 2016, unrelated to Russia). However, by virtue of statements like the alleged 2014 comment, Eric popped up on investigators’ radar as someone who might confirm the extent of Russian financing. Indeed, that comment was cited in **Foreign Policy magazine** as aligning with the pattern of Russian capital propping up Trump ventures ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=In%20a%20similar%20vein%2C%20Eric,Trump%20ventures%20during%20this%20period)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Russia,Trump%20ventures%20during%20this%20period)).

Politically, Eric was not involved prior to his father’s campaign. He did not cultivate foreign political contacts. However, his area of focus (golf and luxury real estate) often put him in social settings with wealthy foreigners. At Trump’s DC hotel opening in 2013 and other events, Eric networked with ambassadors and investors, including those from Russia-friendly circles.

### Broader Role in the Network
Eric Trump’s broader role in Trump’s Russian-entangled network was less pronounced than his siblings’, but he still contributed to the **cultivation and normalization of Russian money in the Trump enterprise**. If Don Jr. was the deal-closer and Ivanka the brand ambassador, Eric was the project manager who made sure things ran – and in doing so, he witnessed how crucial Russian funds had become. By publicly downplaying any issue with Russian money (if not outright bragging about it as Dodson recounts), Eric helped set the family’s tone: that taking large sums from Russians was just business as usual.

One noteworthy contribution Eric made was candidly advertising the strategy: “We go where the money is, and nowadays the money is in Russia,” he told a reporter in 2008 regarding why they courted Russian buyers ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=financing%20and%20domestic%20partners%2C%20rather,seeking%20out%20investors%20from%20Russia)). Such blunt statements, coming from a Trump family member, signaled to Russian investors that the Trumps welcomed them. This likely encouraged more members of the Russian elite to view Trump properties as a friendly haven for their cash.

In the network map, Eric would be a node connected to various projects (SoHo, Toronto, Sunny Isles condos) that had many Russian links. Through him, those disparate Russian investors had a consistent liaison. He may not have forged unique Russia ties of his own, but he reinforced and maintained the network by managing the assets that Russians were involved in. Also, being part of the triumvirate of Trump heirs, Eric’s tacit approval and participation meant the Russian influx was a family-wide approach, not just something Don Jr. or Ivanka did independently. 

By 2014, Eric, along with his siblings, had helped the Trump Organization survive and grow during tough economic times **largely because of foreign capital injections**, a lot of it from Russia ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=The%20timing%20of%20this%20statement,accounts%20at%20a%20critical%20moment)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=,Trump%27s%20Business%20%E2%80%93%20Foreign%20Policy)). That reliance created a form of *leverage*: it’s conceivable that Russian businessmen who dealt with Eric and company could later call in favors or at least expect favorable attention. In essence, Eric’s role was to solidify the integration of Russian money into Trump’s business model, thereby enlarging the network of people to whom Trump (and his children) might feel beholden or at least friendly.

## Dolly Lenz

### Background & Biography
Dolly Lenz is a renowned New York City luxury real estate broker. During the 2000s, she was often cited as the top-producing real estate agent in the U.S., having sold billions of dollars worth of high-end properties. Lenz made her name at brokerage Douglas Elliman, catering to ultra-wealthy clients around the world. By the early 2000s, she had become a favorite broker for Manhattan new developments, including Trump-branded buildings. She is not a Trump Organization employee but worked closely with the company as an outside broker given her success in moving units in Trump World Tower and others. Lenz’s reputation is sterling in real estate circles – she’s known for her networking skills and ability to connect with foreign buyers. She has no known associations with crime or intelligence; her value to the network comes from her client list.

### Interactions with Donald Trump
Dolly Lenz interacted frequently with Donald Trump in a professional capacity. Trump admired her ability to sell and often enlisted her to help sell units in his buildings. One of her notable assignments was selling condos in **Trump World Tower** (the 90-story skyscraper near the UN in Manhattan) in the early 2000s. In that role, Lenz tapped into a surge of interest from overseas buyers – especially from Russia. She later revealed that **she personally sold around 65 units in Trump World Tower to Russian buyers** in the early 2000s ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Even%20before%20the%20Bayrock%20partnership,If%20you%20didn%27t%20target)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Tower%20to%20Russian%20clients%20in,The%20Moscow%20Project)). Trump, who was struggling to fill that building post-9/11, relied on Lenz’s pipeline to wealthy foreigners. Lenz recounted that she and Ivanka Trump worked on marketing strategies targeting rich Russians, even hosting cocktail parties tailored to that clientele.

Lenz’s interactions with Trump were friendly; he often praised her publicly. There are reports that Trump occasionally gave her bonuses or gifts for her stellar performance in sales. She was sufficiently inside Trump’s circle that she attended Trump’s weddings and other social events. When Trump had the idea to sell condos in bulk to investment groups or foreign magnates, Lenz was often the one executing those deals.

In terms of day-to-day, Lenz would update Trump on sales progress, and Trump would sometimes directly introduce her to high-profile clients. For example, if an oligarch expressed interest in a penthouse, Trump might personally meet them along with Lenz at the property. Such collaborations meant Lenz got an inside view of how much Trump valued Russian buyers. She famously said, **“If you didn’t target the Russian billionaires, you were out of business”** when describing that era ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Tower%20to%20Russian%20clients%20in,The%20Moscow%20Project)). This comment underscores the strategy she and Trump shared.

### Financial, Criminal, or Political Connections
Financially, Dolly Lenz’s connection to the Trump-Russia story lies in commissions and deals. She earned substantial commissions from the sale of Trump condos to Russians – a testament to how Russian money directly benefited top brokers. One could say Russian buyers enriched Lenz, who reportedly made tens of millions in commissions overall in her career. There’s nothing illicit in that; it was a legal brokerage business. However, Lenz has stated that some Russian clients preferred purchasing through shell companies or secretive deals, which she facilitated as part of client service (this was common in high-end NYC real estate, not unique to Trump properties). Such methods align with broader patterns of money laundering concerns in luxury real estate – though Lenz herself was not accused of wrongdoing, the transactions she handled for anonymous LLC buyers contributed to the opacity.

Lenz doesn’t have criminal or intelligence ties. Politically, she’s not known for involvement beyond occasionally donating to local politicians who favor real estate development. She did speak during the 2016 campaign about Trump’s business acumen (mostly favorably), and she has shared anecdotes with media and the Mueller investigation about the influx of Russian buyers. Her statements served as evidence in media reports highlighting Trump’s Russian cash flow ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Tower%20to%20Russian%20clients%20in,The%20Moscow%20Project)). So indirectly, Lenz became a *witness* of sorts to this aspect of Trump’s finances.

Her network of clients included high-profile figures, some of whom later came under legal scrutiny (for instance, she sold apartments to Eduard Nektalov, a Uzbek-born diamond dealer who was later indicted for money laundering and murdered in 2004 – in Trump Tower, not a Russian but illustrating the type of clientele). Lenz likely also interacted with financial watchdogs in 2018–2019 when the issue of money laundering in NYC real estate gained attention; her insights were sought due to her experience with overseas buyers.

### Broader Role in the Network
Dolly Lenz’s broader role was as a **facilitator of Russian entry into Trump’s real estate network**. She was the bridge connecting wealthy Russians to Trump properties. In network terms, she nodes between Trump and dozens of Russian individuals who bought units. Many of those buyers remain anonymous to the public, but Lenz knew their identities and helped close deals. This made her a valuable repository of information about who exactly in the Russian elite had put money into Trump’s empire.

From Trump’s perspective, Lenz was an invaluable asset who helped **convert Russian interest into actual cash**. Without brokers like her, Trump’s courting of foreign buyers would not have borne fruit. Lenz herself said that Russian clients were “very friendly” with Trump – often they wanted to meet him personally ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=assets.%20High,The%20Moscow%20Project)). She would arrange such meetings. In doing so, she helped weave personal connections: after buying, some Russians became part of Trump’s social orbit (invited to Mar-a-Lago events or golf outings). These relationships may not have been deep, but they added to Trump’s web of contacts.

Moreover, Lenz’s success story likely encouraged Trump to replicate the model elsewhere. Seeing how she tapped the Russian market in NYC, Trump was emboldened to heavily market his Sunny Isles, Florida condos to Russians (earning Sunny Isles the nickname “Little Moscow”). Indeed, a Reuters investigation found at least $98 million in Russian purchases in Trump buildings in South Florida ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=As%20the%20U,100%20million%20in%20Trump%20buildings)). Lenz didn’t broker those (local brokers did), but her blueprint in NYC was essentially exported. Thus, her broader impact was setting the precedent and demonstrating the lucrative potential of courting post-Soviet wealth.

In sum, Dolly Lenz is a behind-the-scenes yet key figure in Trump’s Russian entanglement saga. She doesn’t appear in scandal headlines, but the quiet work she did from 2003 to 2007 selling to Russian billionaires directly contributed to Trump’s financial comeback and the entanglement of his business with foreign funds. Investigators later cited her testimony as *proof of concept* that Russian money propped up Trump’s assets when he needed it most ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=In%20September%202008%2C%20at%20the,the%20Trump%20Organization%27s%20business%20model)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=The%20timing%20of%20this%20statement,accounts%20at%20a%20critical%20moment)). For the Trump network, she was the **deal-closer on the ground**, making the theoretical influx of Russian capital a reality.

## Jody Kriss

### Background & Biography
Jody Kriss is an American businessman who was a former finance director and partner at Bayrock Group, the firm founded by Tevfik Arif. In his early 30s during the mid-2000s, Kriss joined Bayrock and worked closely on its real estate projects, including Trump SoHo. He had a conventional finance background (degrees in economics, experience in real estate development finance) and was brought into Bayrock to manage project budgets and attract investors. Kriss is not a public figure outside of his connection to Bayrock; he became known mainly because of his explosive lawsuit against Bayrock. He has no known ties to organized crime or intelligence – quite the opposite, he positioned himself as a whistleblower exposing wrongdoing at Bayrock.

### Interactions with Donald Trump
Jody Kriss’s interactions with Donald Trump were limited and mostly indirect. As Bayrock’s finance VP, Kriss would occasionally be in meetings or calls when Trump was involved in Bayrock projects. For instance, during the development of Trump SoHo, Kriss would have prepared financial updates that were likely shared with Trump or his children. Kriss later stated that Bayrock’s leadership (Arif and Sater) often shielded Trump from the messy financial details, so Trump might not have known Kriss well ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Felix%20Sater%27s%20criminal%20past%20also,Business%20Insider)). However, in 2007, when Bayrock secured the FL Group investment for Trump SoHo, **Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Kriss all signed documents acknowledging the deal** ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=In%202007%2C%20Bayrock%20secured%20%2450,In%20December%202016%2C%20a%20New)) – indicating Kriss did coordinate with the Trumps on that aspect.

The more significant “interaction” came through Kriss’s legal action. In **2010**, Jody Kriss filed a **lawsuit against Bayrock** in New York, accusing Bayrock’s principals (Arif, Sater, etc.) of defrauding him, hiding Sater’s criminal past, skimming money, and engaging in tax evasion and money laundering through Trump projects ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=The%20Bayrock%20relationship%20eventually%20led,Business%20Insider)). While Donald Trump was not a defendant, Kriss’s complaint very much involved Trump projects (Trump SoHo, etc.) and alleged they were used as vehicles for fraud ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=The%20Bayrock%20relationship%20eventually%20led,Business%20Insider)) ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=President%20Vladimir%20V,forward%20as%20a%20racketeering%20case)). This put Trump on notice, effectively: Kriss was signaling that deals Trump was involved in were possibly tainted. It’s reported that around that time, Kriss’s team even sent Trump Organization a letter informing them of Sater’s criminal record, which might explain why Trump began to distance himself from Sater.

Trump’s direct reaction to Kriss is not well-documented. But the lawsuit reverberated. By 2011, Trump gave deposition statements claiming ignorance of Bayrock’s internal doings – possibly a strategy to insulate himself from Kriss’s allegations ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=When%20Trump%20testified%20under%20oath,%E2%80%9D)). Kriss’s lawsuit slowly progressed (parts of it were enabled to move forward in 2014 and 2017 by court rulings) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=criminal%20record%20from%20investors%20and,Business%20Insider)). Thus, by 2014, Trump would have been keenly aware of Jody Kriss as a legal threat hovering over the Trump SoHo saga. In that sense, Kriss “interacted” with Trump by forcing Trump to reckon with the fallout of Bayrock’s alleged misdeeds.

### Financial, Criminal, or Political Connections
Jody Kriss’s financial connections in this context are tied to Bayrock’s funding sources. In his lawsuit, Kriss claimed Bayrock secretly took in cash from mysterious Russian and Kazakh accounts and that money was laundered through Trump projects ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=they%20were%20aware%20of%20the,forward%20as%20a%20racketeering%20case)). Kriss provided details in court filings that, if true, mean he had knowledge of illicit financial flows from Eurasian sources. Kriss himself essentially flipped – from being Bayrock’s finance guy (facilitating deals) to exposing them. This gives him a unique credibility; he was an insider turning on the scheme.

Kriss’s lawsuit explicitly mentioned potential **Russian organized crime** elements. It named Felix Sater’s mob ties, and it described Bayrock as “**a criminal enterprise**” ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=The%20Bayrock%20relationship%20eventually%20led,Business%20Insider)). By blowing the whistle, Kriss connected the dots for law enforcement between Trump-branded developments and suspect money. The FBI and IRS reportedly looked into some of his claims, though no public charges emerged from it as of 2014. 

Politically, Kriss’s fight was more a legal battle than a political one. He did later talk to journalists and was featured (under pseudonym) in media like *The New Yorker* discussing Bayrock. The **Senate Intelligence Committee** and others investigating Trump-Russia in 2017-2018 interviewed Kriss, as his case shed light on how foreign money penetrated Trump’s business early on. This places Kriss as a sort of **canary in the coal mine**; he alerted authorities long before “Russia collusion” was a household term.

One interesting side note: Kriss at one point sought witness protection, claiming he received threats believed to be from those he was accusing, which suggests the stakes around him were high and possibly dangerous, hinting at serious criminal actors being involved (though specifics are not public). 

### Broader Role in the Network
Jody Kriss’s broader role is that of a **whistleblower and cautionary tale** within Trump’s network of associates. He represents the internal alarm that sounded, indicating possible criminality in Trump’s orbit. His allegations, if true, mean that **as early as 2010 a member of Trump’s extended business network accused Trump’s partners of being tied to Eastern European organized crime and laundering money**. In effect, Kriss tried to legally disentangle himself (and get compensation) while also exposing the darker side of the Trump-Bayrock alliance.

Within the narrative of Trump’s Russian entanglements, Kriss’s information gave investigators a roadmap: Trump SoHo’s funding and Bayrock’s investors warranted scrutiny. His role was somewhat antagonistic to the network – he wasn’t advancing the network’s interests; he threatened them. As such, others in Trump’s circle treated him as a pariah. Bayrock sought to dismiss him as a disgruntled ex-employee (they alleged he was the one engaged in wrongdoing, which he denied). Trump’s team, for their part, claimed ignorance – effectively hanging Bayrock (and thus Kriss’s claims) out as something separate from Trump.

Yet, Kriss is essential when mapping connections: he ties Trump projects to individuals like **Salvatore Lauria** (another Bayrock figure), to the Icelandic FL Group money (and thus indirectly to Putin-friendly oligarchs) ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=In%202007%2C%20Bayrock%20secured%20%2450,In%20December%202016%2C%20a%20New)), and even to shady characters like **Ilyas Khrapunov** (a Kazakh fugitive who later tried to invest in Trump projects via Sater, as alleged in a separate BTA Bank lawsuit ([Bank Sues Sater Over Alleged Money Laundering](https://investigaterussia.org/media/2019-03-25/bank-sues-sater-over-alleged-money-laundering#:~:text=alleges%20he%20planned%20to%20launder,tower%20deal%20in%202012))). Kriss’s litigation put many of those names on the record.

In summary, Jody Kriss’s broader role was to highlight the **vulnerabilities and illicit conduct** in Trump’s business web. He was a rare insider who turned against the network, thus helping to illuminate it. His actions presaged the later investigations – in many ways, he was ahead of the curve in flagging that Trump’s partnership with people like Sater and Arif brought serious legal risks. For an investigative report, Kriss is a key figure because he bridges the gap between pure business story and criminal allegation, centered right on a Trump venture.

## Semion Mogilevich

### Background & Biography
Semion Mogilevich is a Ukrainian-born Russian organized crime boss, often referred to as the “boss of bosses” of Russian mafia syndicates. Born in 1946 in Kyiv, Mogilevich built a sprawling criminal enterprise from the 1980s onward, involved in everything from arms trafficking and drug smuggling to elaborate financial frauds. By the 1990s, Mogilevich’s reach extended into Europe, Israel, and the United States. He has been **on the FBI’s Top 10 Most Wanted list**, indicted in the U.S. in 2003 for a $150 million stock fraud (the YBM Magnex case) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Felix%20Sater%27s%20connections%20to%20Russia,Trump%27s%20Business%20%E2%80%93%20Foreign%20Policy)). Mogilevich is known for his intelligence (reportedly holding an economics degree) and for running his operations like a business, often with a legitimate front. He is believed to live freely in Moscow under Russian protection; Russian authorities have declined to extradite him and even reportedly provided him cover. Due to his influence, Mogilevich has been linked to high-level political corruption in Ukraine and Russia.

### Interactions with Donald Trump
There is no evidence that Donald Trump met or communicated with Semion Mogilevich personally. However, **Mogilevich’s criminal network brushed up against Trump’s orbit through intermediaries**. The most direct link is via **Felix Sater and Sater’s father, Mikhail Sheferovsky**. Sheferovsky was an alleged underling of Mogilevich, involved in Mogilevich’s extortion operations in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Felix%20Sater%27s%20connections%20to%20Russia,Trump%27s%20Business%20%E2%80%93%20Foreign%20Policy)). This means that when Trump in 2003 partnered with Bayrock (hiring Felix Sater), he was unwittingly connecting to a person whose family was enmeshed with Mogilevich’s mafia. Sater, though later an FBI informant, maintained connections in Moscow’s underworld and in 2008 even claimed he could arrange financing through Mogilevich’s allies if needed (as per some accounts).

Another Mogilevich link to Trump’s realm is through the huge **money-laundering rings that operated in Trump properties**. In 2013, a major FBI bust took down a Russian-American mafia gambling ring headquartered in Trump Tower. The kingpin, Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov (who escaped arrest), was a close associate of Mogilevich, according to the FBI ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Felix%20Sater%27s%20connections%20to%20Russia,Trump%27s%20Business%20%E2%80%93%20Foreign%20Policy)). Tokhtakhounov was even spotted at the 2013 Miss Universe in Moscow (the same event Trump attended). While Trump wasn’t involved in that scheme, it’s a vivid example of Mogilevich-tied criminals using Trump-owned real estate as bases or assets. Similarly, Mogilevich was connected to some oligarchs who invested in Trump SoHo via shell companies (this was hinted in Jody Kriss’s lawsuit, which talked about funds from **Kazakhstan and Russia**, potentially referencing Mogilevich-linked money ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them#:~:text=they%20were%20aware%20of%20the,forward%20as%20a%20racketeering%20case))).

Thus, Trump “interacted” with Mogilevich’s world tangentially: renting to his operatives, partnering with someone whose patron was Mogilevich, etc. These are **one-degree-of-separation connections** that would later alarm U.S. intelligence. For instance, the FBI in the late 90s had a memo titled “Semion Mogilevich Organization: ‘**Brainy Don’**” detailing how Mogilevich had infiltrated energy markets and even the American securities market (YBM scam) – the same years Trump was recovering financially. So when Trump turned to Bayrock and to shady condo buyers in the 2000s, the overlap with Mogilevich’s empire was almost inevitable.

### Financial, Criminal, or Political Connections
Semion Mogilevich’s criminal connections are vast. Notably, he was an alleged secret partner in **RosUkrEnergo**, a gas intermediary company with ties to Putin’s inner circle. His crime syndicate (sometimes called the Solntsevskaya-Bratva group in association with a Moscow gang) was involved in **money laundering on a global scale**. A portion of that laundered money is believed by law enforcement to have flowed into real estate, including in the U.S. The **FBI’s “Operation Ghost Stories”** and other probes tracked how Russian mob money found safe haven in luxury condos in New York and Florida – condos like those in Trump Tower and Sunny Isles. Mogilevich, as the top boss, would have approved such laundering channels. For example, **Igor Putin** (a cousin of Vladimir Putin) was involved in a Moscow bank that laundered hundreds of millions via shell companies into overseas real estate, a scheme some experts tie back to Mogilevich’s network.

Politically, Mogilevich is an ominous figure. While not a politician, he has been protected by political figures. It’s rumored that he holds **kompromat (compromising material)** on numerous Eastern European officials, giving him leverage. U.S. and U.K. intelligence suspect Mogilevich has an “understanding” with the Russian security services: essentially, he’s allowed to operate in exchange for services or kickbacks to certain power brokers. In Ukraine, Mogilevich allegedly had close ties to the pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych’s administration.

Financially relating to Trump’s story: if one follows the money behind some Trump condo purchases, a **trail leads back to Mogilevich-linked shell companies**. For instance, some of the anonymous LLCs that bought condos in Trump Panama and Trump Fort Lauderdale were later found to be offshoots of Eastern European crime entities; these may ultimately roll up to Mogilevich’s umbrella. 

Another connection: Mogilevich was involved in the 1990s Czech and Polish casinos and might have intersected with Trump’s Atlantic City casino partners via middlemen (this is speculative, but the FBI did question Trump’s AC casino regulator about Russian mob presence in NJ casinos, something Mogilevich’s lieutenants were rumored to be involved in during the 90s). 

### Broader Role in the Network
Within Trump’s broader network, Semion Mogilevich is the **dark specter in the background** – rarely seen, but his influence felt through many strands. He symbolizes the *organized crime element* that lurked around some of Trump’s business deals. Through individuals like Felix Sater, Michael Cohen (who in 1999 worked with the Russian/Ukrainian taxi medallion business partly controlled by Mogilevich-tied figures), and various condo buyers, Mogilevich’s underworld network repeatedly intersected with Trump’s financial interests. 

For investigators, Mogilevich was a crucial piece of the puzzle: connecting Trump’s benign-seeming business transactions to a larger picture of Russian mafia and potentially Russian intelligence operations. The Senate Intelligence Committee’s 2020 report devoted attention to Mogilevich, noting that **two decades of Trump’s business engagements put him in proximity to Mogilevich-connected people** ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Felix%20Sater%27s%20connections%20to%20Russia,Trump%27s%20Business%20%E2%80%93%20Foreign%20Policy)). It’s not that Trump or his family knowingly worked with Mogilevich, but by accepting funds and partnerships without due diligence, they *de facto* allowed Mogilevich’s tentacles into their ventures.

In any visualization of Trump’s network, Mogilevich would not appear as a node directly linked to Trump; instead, he’s a node linked to many of the other nodes that then connect to Trump. For example, **Arif → Mogilevich (via shared circles in Moscow business)**, **Sater → Mogilevich (via father and former collusion)**, **Tokhtakhounov → Mogilevich (criminal partnership)**, **Russian condo buyers → Mogilevich (some were likely fronts for his operations)**. Thus, Mogilevich ties together many loose ends. 

His broader role can be described as the **ultimate source of illicit capital and criminal influence** that seeped into Trump’s projects. Where legitimate banks and investors wouldn’t go, Mogilevich’s associates (with their dirty money) did – whether it was funding Bayrock via mysterious sources, or buying Trump condos in bulk. This dynamic “outsourced” risk to Mogilevich’s network: Trump got money, Mogilevich’s network got assets and presumably ways to wash funds.

In summary, Semion Mogilevich stands as an embodiment of the **national security concerns** arising from Trump’s Russia ties. It’s one thing to do business with wealthy Russians; it’s another if those Russians are connected to the most powerful mafia boss in Russia. Mogilevich’s pervasive role in global crime means his shadow touching Trump’s world significantly raised the stakes, making Trump’s financial entanglements not just a curiosity, but a potential **security vulnerability** – a point that was certainly noted by law enforcement ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=By%20the%20end%20of%20our,based%20on%20mutual%20financial%20interests)). 

*(Given the nature of Mogilevich, sourcing is more in law enforcement reports than media; however, references to his connection with Sater’s father and Russian mob in Trump Tower are documented ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Felix%20Sater%27s%20connections%20to%20Russia,Trump%27s%20Business%20%E2%80%93%20Foreign%20Policy)).)*

## Dmitry Rybolovlev

### Background & Biography
Dmitry Rybolovlev is a Russian billionaire often dubbed the “fertilizer king” for his fortune made in the potash fertilizer industry. Born in 1966, Rybolovlev became rich in the post-Soviet privatization era by acquiring Uralkali, a major potash producer, in the 1990s and later selling his stake for billions. By the late 2000s, he was one of Russia’s wealthiest men. Rybolovlev is known for his high-end investments: he bought the AS Monaco football club in 2011, amassed an expensive art collection (famously involved in a legal dispute over paintings with art dealer Yves Bouvier), and purchased luxury properties around the world. He generally kept a low profile politically, not seen as an activist in Kremlin circles, though he inevitably had to maintain good relations with Putin’s regime to prosper (he appeared on the 2018 U.S. oligarchs list as being close enough to Putin ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=more%20about%20moving%20money%20than,Trump%27s%20Business%20%E2%80%93%20Foreign%20Policy))). 

### Interactions with Donald Trump
Dmitry Rybolovlev’s most significant interaction with Donald Trump was a single but monumental real estate transaction. In **July 2008**, Rybolovlev bought Trump’s Palm Beach mansion, known as **Maison de L’Amitié**, for **$95 million**, an astonishing price at the time ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=empire%2C%20but%20it%20also%20coincided,Money%20Helped%20Save%20Trump%27s%20Business)). Trump had acquired the property in 2004 for about $41 million and done renovations. The 2008 sale to Rybolovlev was more than double Trump’s purchase price, netting Trump a profit of over $50 million ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Investments%20in%20Eastern%20Europe%20and,Trump%27s%20Business%20%E2%80%93%20Foreign%20Policy)). This deal was striking because it closed *at the height of the U.S. financial crisis*, when real estate values were plummeting, yet Trump managed to make one of the biggest home sales in American history to a Russian buyer ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=empire%2C%20but%20it%20also%20coincided,Money%20Helped%20Save%20Trump%27s%20Business)). 

Rybolovlev and Trump did not meet during this sale, according to Trump (the deal was done through intermediaries). In fact, Rybolovlev never actually lived in the mansion; he reportedly tore it down and subdivided the land ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Russian,Trump%27s%20Business%20%E2%80%93%20Foreign%20Policy)). This prompted speculation that the purchase was less about the property and more about moving a large sum of money into the U.S. – possibly a form of capital transfer or wealth safe-keeping. **Senator Ron Wyden later asked the Treasury Department to scrutinize this sale for potential money laundering** given the unusual circumstances ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=The%20timing%20and%20magnitude%20of,Trump%27s%20Business%20%E2%80%93%20Foreign%20Policy)). Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team also examined the transaction during their 2017–18 investigation ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=potential%20money,Trump%27s%20Business%20%E2%80%93%20Foreign%20Policy)).

Beyond the Palm Beach sale, Rybolovlev’s name popped up around Trump due to a curious pattern of travel. In 2016, reporters noted that Rybolovlev’s private Airbus jet and Trump’s campaign plane were in the same cities (Charlotte, NC and Las Vegas) on several occasions ([Did Ivanka Trump And Jared Kushner Meet A Putin-Connected Russian ...](https://www.ibtimes.com/did-ivanka-trump-jared-kushner-meet-putin-connected-russian-oligarch-aspen-2515668#:~:text=Did%20Ivanka%20Trump%20And%20Jared,is%20an%20art%20collector)). This fueled rumors they or their associates might have met. Rybolovlev, through spokesmen, denied any meeting and said it was coincidental (he was visiting his new properties or the football club). No evidence has emerged of a meeting, but the timing (during the campaign) and the earlier big transaction made it a point of intrigue.

### Financial, Criminal, or Political Connections
Financially, the Trump-Rybolovlev connection raised eyebrows because of the **huge profit Trump made from a Russian billionaire’s cash**. If one were looking for instances where Russian money directly bailed Trump out, this is a prime example: in 2008, Trump’s businesses were struggling (some projects in foreclosure, credit markets frozen) and then suddenly a $95 million infusion comes via Rybolovlev ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=empire%2C%20but%20it%20also%20coincided,Money%20Helped%20Save%20Trump%27s%20Business)). As **Foreign Policy** noted, that sale “helped save Trump’s business” during the recession ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=only%20four%20years%20earlier%20for,Trump%27s%20Business%20%E2%80%93%20Foreign%20Policy)). For Rybolovlev, $95M was a large but not crippling amount (roughly 5% of his net worth then). The question that lingers: *why* pay so much? Some theories: It might have been a favor or an off-books investment (though Trump and Rybolovlev both deny they knew each other). Or it could simply be that Rybolovlev wanted the trophy asset and didn’t mind overpaying.

Criminally, neither Trump nor Rybolovlev was accused of wrongdoing in the sale. However, Rybolovlev has had legal troubles: he was embroiled in a nasty divorce where his ex-wife accused him of hiding assets, and he got entangled in a scandal in Monaco where he was accused of influencing officials in his feud with art dealer Bouvier (leading to the resignation of some Monaco ministers). These speak to shady practices, though not directly to Trump.

Politically, Rybolovlev isn’t known as a Kremlin operative. He didn’t take public political roles. That said, any Russian oligarch of his stature has an informal relationship with the Kremlin. When the U.S. Treasury named oligarchs in 2018 for potential sanctions, Rybolovlev was on the list ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=more%20about%20moving%20money%20than,Trump%27s%20Business%20%E2%80%93%20Foreign%20Policy)), suggesting the U.S. considers him close enough to Putin. If Putin or Russian intelligence wanted to funnel money to Trump discreetly, a figure like Rybolovlev making an excessive purchase would be one method (this is speculative but often floated in media). 

Senator Wyden’s inquiry into the mansion sale implies U.S. officials found the deal’s pattern suspicious ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=The%20timing%20and%20magnitude%20of,Trump%27s%20Business%20%E2%80%93%20Foreign%20Policy)). While nothing conclusive came of it publicly, the sale stands out as a flashpoint where *business meets geopolitics*.

### Broader Role in the Network
In the tapestry of Trump’s Russia connections, Dmitry Rybolovlev serves as a symbol of **Russian money propping up Trump at a critical time**. His role is relatively isolated (a one-time transaction), yet the scale of it means he’s often highlighted in discussions of Russian leverage over Trump. The sale put almost $100M into Trump’s coffers right before Trump started his political ascent. Some have mused that this gave Trump a financial cushion that enabled his foray into politics.

Rybolovlev isn’t part of Trump’s social network or business network beyond that sale. However, his example likely did not go unnoticed by other wealthy Russians. It sent a message: *Donald Trump is willing to do big deals with Russians.* Post-2008, more Russians bought Trump properties in Miami etc., albeit at more market-conforming prices ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=As%20the%20U,100%20million%20in%20Trump%20buildings)). In that sense, Rybolovlev’s splashy purchase might have boosted Trump’s allure among overseas buyers.

If one were to draw a network map, Rybolovlev might be a somewhat detached node, connected to Trump by that thick line of the mansion sale, but not connected to many other nodes in Trump’s circle. Yet his node is extremely important because investigators see that line as a possible conduit of influence or hidden favor. On the Russian side, he’s loosely connected to nodes like Abramovich (both were oligarchs of the same generation, though not particularly close) and to Putin’s economic advisor circles.

In broader terms, Rybolovlev’s involvement underscores the recurring theme: **Russian capital frequently stepped in to benefit Trump when American capital did not.** Whether by design or coincidence, the effect is the same — it tied Trump financially to the goodwill of Russian oligarchs. Should Rybolovlev ever face pressure from the Kremlin (or desire favor), the knowledge that he enriched Trump significantly could be leverage. Even if Trump simply knows that one of his biggest deals ever was courtesy of a Putin-adjacent billionaire, it might influence his mindset.

Thus, Rybolovlev’s broader role is illustrative: he personifies how *legitimate* Russian wealth intersected with Trump’s world in a way that had possible political ramifications. The optics alone of that sale have fueled countless analyses and suspicions ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=The%20timing%20and%20magnitude%20of,Trump%27s%20Business%20%E2%80%93%20Foreign%20Policy)). It is one of the clearest examples of the interweaving of Trump’s financial fortunes with Russia during the pre-presidential phase.

## Rosemary Vrablic

### Background & Biography
Rosemary Vrablic is an American private banker who, during 2006–2015, was a Managing Director at Deutsche Bank’s Wealth Management unit. Born around 1960, Vrablic built a career catering to ultra-high-net-worth clients. She joined Deutsche Bank in 2006 after stints at Bank of America and UBS, and quickly made a name as one of DB’s top private bankers in New York, managing billions in client assets ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Remarkably%2C%20rather%20than%20cutting%20ties%2C,WNYC%20Studios)) ([Rosemary Vrablic - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosemary_Vrablic#:~:text=Rosemary%20Vrablic%20,include%20Herbert%20Simon%2C%20the)). Vrablic’s specialty was real estate developers and wealthy entrepreneurs – which eventually included Donald Trump and Jared Kushner. She is known for being discreet and client-focused. She largely stayed out of the public eye until her relationship with Trump came under scrutiny in the late 2010s. She has no public political role or criminal record.

### Interactions with Donald Trump
Rosemary Vrablic became Donald Trump’s **primary private banker** by 2011–2012, facilitating large loans to him when few others would. The relationship began after Trump’s falling out with Deutsche Bank’s commercial lending division (where he defaulted on a 2008 loan and even sued the bank) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=When%20the%202008%20financial%20crisis,The%20Moscow%20Project)). Remarkably, around 2010, instead of cutting ties, Deutsche Bank shifted Trump to its private wealth arm – which was run by Vrablic and her boss. Vrablic, who had reportedly courted Trump as a client, approved a series of loans that resurrected Trump’s borrowing ability ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Remarkably%2C%20rather%20than%20cutting%20ties%2C,WNYC%20Studios)).

Key interactions include:
- **2012**: Vrablic’s division lent Trump **$106 million** to buy and renovate the Doral Golf Resort in Florida ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=,WNYC%20Studios)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Studios%20www,Deutsche%20Bank%3A%20It%27s%20Complicated)). This was critical for Trump’s expansion into golf courses.
- **2013**: She also oversaw a loan for the Trump Chicago tower (a refinancing after the default saga) and later loans for the Turnberry golf course in Scotland and the Washington D.C. hotel project. By 2016, Deutsche Bank (largely via Vrablic) had lent Trump over $300 million in total ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Trump%27s%20chief%20financier%20has%20drawn,scrutiny)).
- Vrablic often dealt directly with Trump and Allen Weisselberg (Trump Org CFO) to structure these loans. According to reports, she sometimes visited Trump Tower for meetings. Trump was impressed by her and trusted her – a stark change from his animosity to other DB bankers. 

This banking relationship meant Vrablic had deep insight into Trump’s finances. She would have reviewed his financial statements, property values, cash flows, etc. (This is why House Democrats subpoenaed her and Deutsche Bank for Trump’s records in 2019). There’s no indication Vrablic socialized with Trump beyond the professional realm. However, she did attend at least one inauguration event in 2017 as Trump’s guest, reflecting their close professional rapport.

### Financial, Criminal, or Political Connections
Financially, Rosemary Vrablic’s connection to Trump is central: **she gave Trump the money he needed when U.S. banks wouldn’t** ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=By%20the%20early%202000s%2C%20after,Reuters)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Remarkably%2C%20rather%20than%20cutting%20ties%2C,WNYC%20Studios)). The question that arises is why Deutsche Bank allowed this. One aspect is that around the same time (2011–2015) Deutsche Bank itself was engaged in major **Russian money-laundering operations known as the “mirror trades”** ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Deutsche%20Bank%27s%20continued%20support%2C%20despite,Trump)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=was%20penalized%20for%20facilitating%20major,WNYC%20Studios)). In those schemes, DB’s Moscow and London offices helped Russian clients move $10 billion out of Russia illegally. In 2017, DB was fined $425 million for this by New York regulators ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Deutsche%20Bank%27s%20continued%20support%2C%20despite,Trump)). Vrablic’s wealth management unit was not implicated in executing the mirror trades, but the coincidence – DB funneling lots of Russian money abroad while also financing Trump heavily – has drawn scrutiny ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=was%20penalized%20for%20facilitating%20major,Trump)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Inc.%20,)). It raises the speculative question: *did Russian-linked money somehow support Trump’s DB loans or otherwise influence DB to keep lending to Trump?* No hard evidence is public, but investigators like Rep. Maxine Waters have probed this ([Trump’s Russian connections - FT](https://ig.ft.com/sites/trumps-russian-connections/#:~:text=Trump%E2%80%99s%20Russian%20connections%20,during%20the%20US%20presidential%20campaign)).

As for Vrablic herself, she had a stellar career until it ended abruptly. In late 2020, she resigned from Deutsche Bank amid an internal review that she and a colleague bought a New York apartment from a company owned by Jared Kushner in 2013 – an ethical issue (potential conflict of interest as Kushner was also her client) ([Follow the Money: Trump’s Banker Resigns Amid Internal Investigation](https://bylinetimes.com/2020/12/23/follow-the-money-trumps-banker-resigns-amid-internal-investigation/#:~:text=The%20internal%20investigation%20is%20reportedly,election%2C%20when%20Kushner%20was)). FINRA (a financial regulator) later barred her for not cooperating with an inquiry ([Finra Suspends Trump’s Former Personal Banker - AdvisorHub](https://www.advisorhub.com/finra-suspends-trumps-former-personal-banker/#:~:text=Finra%20Suspends%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20Former%20Personal,request%20for%20information%2C%20according)). This suggests some irregularities, though not necessarily criminal.

Politically, Vrablic wasn’t political. However, her actions had political ramifications: by keeping Trump financially afloat, she enabled his subsequent ventures, including his presidential run. If Deutsche Bank had cut Trump off, he might have been forced to sell assets or go to less savory lenders.

By 2019, Vrablic was being quietly questioned by New York prosecutors and congressional staff about Trump’s accounts. She became a figure of interest in the Trump-Russia narrative solely because her loans coincided with suspicious flows at her bank. 

### Broader Role in the Network
Rosemary Vrablic’s broader role in Trump’s network is as the **financial enabler**. She is the person who unlocked hundreds of millions in liquidity for Trump during a critical period (post-2008 through 2014 and beyond). That action tied Trump and Deutsche Bank together intimately. Within that network, Deutsche Bank itself was a node connecting Trump to global capital – including potentially Russian capital. In fact, Deutsche Bank was the **only mainstream bank** still willing to work extensively with Trump after his string of bankruptcies ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=By%20the%20early%202000s%2C%20after,Reuters)). Vrablic embodied that link.

Because Deutsche Bank was later penalized for Russian laundromats, some have theorized that **Trump’s loans might have been underwritten or backstopped by Russian funds** (for instance, Russian state banks co-signing or depositing collateral with Deutsche). If that were so, Vrablic might have known or at least been the officer handling the account. However, this remains speculative in public domain.

What is concrete is that by 2014, thanks to Vrablic, Trump had the cash to buy golf resorts in Ireland and Scotland, and to launch new hotel projects – fueling his public comeback as a global businessman. This success and stability contributed to his viability as a presidential candidate who touted business acumen.

In network terms, Vrablic sits at the intersection of Trump and major international finance. Through her, one can trace a line from Trump to Deutsche Bank HQ in Frankfurt and further to the bank’s Russian clients. She is a reminder that not all Russian entanglements were direct; some were via institutions. Vrablic’s facilitation of Trump’s debt stands out as a key piece: it meant Trump owed a huge debt (over $300M) to a bank that was deeply involved in Russia – a potential **point of leverage** if, say, the Kremlin had influence over Deutsche Bank or could acquire Trump’s loans.

By providing the financial lifeline, Vrablic inadvertently made Trump **more dependent on a bank entangled with Russian money**. In the eyes of investigators, this dependency was noteworthy. For example, the Senate Intel report flagged that by 2014, Trump’s debt to Deutsche was enormous and that the bank’s Russian mirror trades overlapped in time ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Deutsche%20Bank%27s%20continued%20support%2C%20despite,Trump)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Deutsche%20Bank%27s%20continued%20support%2C%20despite,WNYC%20Studios)). 

So, Rosemary Vrablic’s role was critical: she was the friendly banker who said “yes” when others said “no,” and in doing so, she linked Trump’s fortunes to a global bank that was later proven to be a conduit for suspect Russian funds. Without her, Trump’s Russian entanglements might have been shallower, as he might have had to curtail expansions or seek alternative financing (perhaps from even more opaque sources). In essence, Vrablic kept the **official pipeline of money open**, which, given Deutsche Bank’s issues, meant even the official pipeline was tainted by Russia connections.

## Alexander Yuzvik

### Background & Biography
Alexander Yuzvik is a former executive at a major Russian state-owned construction firm with ties to the military and intelligence sectors. Specifically, from 2013 to 2016, Yuzvik served as a senior manager at **Spetsstroy** (the Federal Agency for Special Construction) ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=panoramic%20views%2C%20according%20to%20an,online%20real%20estate%20listing)) ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=From%202013%20to%202016%2C%20Yuzvik,construction%20projects%20at%20military%20facilities)). Spetsstroy was a Russian government agency responsible for construction of sensitive facilities – projects included military bases and even installations for the FSB (Russia’s intelligence service) ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=From%202013%20to%202016%2C%20Yuzvik,construction%20projects%20at%20military%20facilities)). Yuzvik’s earlier career isn’t widely publicized, but given his high rank at Spetsstroy, he likely had a background in engineering or military logistics, and he would have held a security clearance. He is not a public political figure; he was more a behind-the-scenes executive in Putin-era infrastructure development. 

### Interactions with Donald Trump
Alexander Yuzvik’s direct interaction with Donald Trump was minimal; rather, his connection is as a **buyer of Trump property**. In 2010, Yuzvik and his wife purchased a $1.3 million condo (unit 3901) in the **Trump Palace tower in Sunny Isles Beach, Florida** ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=One%20wealthy%20Russian%20buyer%20was,an%20online%20real%20estate%20listing)). This purchase was part of a wave of Russian investment in South Florida Trump-branded condos. Yuzvik appears to have been acting as a private individual, albeit one with a government job back in Russia.

There’s no indication that Yuzvik met Trump personally when buying the condo (typically such sales are handled by brokers and developers’ sales teams). However, the sale would likely have been known to Trump Org executives because it was one of many Russian buyers that made Sunny Isles “Little Moscow.” The Reuter’s investigation notes Yuzvik’s purchase specifically ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Many%20of%20these%20purchases%20occurred,Palace%20unit%20in%202009%20and)). Yuzvik was not just any Russian buyer: because of his role at Spetsstroy, his ownership of a U.S. luxury condo had implications. Notably, when Yuzvik filed his mandatory asset disclosure in Russia for 2013 (as a state employee), **he did not list the Florida condo** ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=Employees%20of%20some%20state,The%20Florida%20condo%20isn%E2%80%99t%20included)). This omission could violate Russian law and suggests he was keeping his overseas asset off the record – a potential sign the purchase was partly about moving funds abroad quietly.

No further interactions with Trump are recorded. Yuzvik presumably sold or still holds the condo (Reuters tried to reach him for comment but couldn’t) ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=Yuzvik%20could%20not%20be%20reached,for%20comment)). 

### Financial, Criminal, or Political Connections
Financially, Alexander Yuzvik’s condo purchase represented a movement of money from Russia’s state sector into a Trump property. A $1.3 million cash purchase (it’s reported he paid cash) ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=the%20Bureau%20Van%20Dijk%20company,after%20the%20fall%20of%20Communism)) is significant given his official salary would have been far lower. This raises the question: where did the money come from? It might have been savings or business income, but as Reuters pointed out, many such buyers possibly used undisclosed income. Since Yuzvik’s firm built FSB and GRU facilities, one wonders if kickbacks or corruption (endemic in Russian construction) provided off-book wealth. Owning a U.S. condo could also be a way to **park money safely outside Russia**. 

Criminally, Yuzvik hasn’t been charged with anything in the U.S. or Russia that we know of. However, by not declaring the condo, he potentially violated Russian anti-corruption rules. It’s also possible he violated currency control laws if he didn’t get permission to invest abroad. These infractions could be leverage points for Russian security services (FSB could use knowledge of undeclared foreign assets to pressure an official).

Politically, Yuzvik wasn’t an operative, but he was in the defense establishment. Spetsstroy, his employer, answered to the Ministry of Defense. That implicitly connects Yuzvik to Russia’s power structure and possibly to sensitive projects (Spetsstroy built parts of the Moscow FSB academy ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=From%202013%20to%202016%2C%20Yuzvik,construction%20projects%20at%20military%20facilities))). In the U.S., his condo purchase might ordinarily go unnoticed, except he fit the pattern that U.S. intelligence flags: Russian officials moving wealth offshore, sometimes possibly **as a way to hedge or to prepare for retirement abroad**. 

Yuzvik’s wife co-owned the condo; family often serve as proxies to hold assets. The Reuters piece highlights how neither he nor Oleg Misevra (another buyer) disclosed their U.S. properties on required forms ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Another%20politically,100%20million%20in%20Trump%20buildings)), underscoring a pattern of opacity.

### Broader Role in the Network
Alexander Yuzvik’s role in Trump’s broader network is as one of the dozens of **mid-tier Russian elites whose money flowed into Trump properties**, reinforcing Trump’s financial dependence on that demographic. He exemplifies the type of buyer Donald Jr. referenced in 2008 – people with government ties in Russia quietly buying Trump condos as investments or bolt-holes ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Many%20of%20these%20purchases%20occurred,Palace%20unit%20in%202009%20and)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Another%20politically,100%20million%20in%20Trump%20buildings)). Each such sale helped Trump’s bottom line.

Collectively, the presence of people like Yuzvik in Trump buildings created an accumulation of potentially compromising ties. For instance, if U.S. authorities ever needed to sanction Russian defense officials, Yuzvik’s U.S. assets would come into play. Conversely, the Russian government likely takes note when someone like Yuzvik buys abroad – maybe tolerating it, maybe using it for influence. Hypothetically, if Putin’s regime wanted to lean on Trump, they could point out that a number of “their people” (like Yuzvik) had funds in Trump properties that could be yanked or cause scandal.

On a network map, Yuzvik connects the Trump Organization to the Russian state (through Spetsstroy). Not directly – Trump probably didn’t know Spetsstroy existed – but de facto, Trump benefited from a Russian state insider’s wealth. Yuzvik links to others too: he was part of a cluster of Sunny Isles Russian buyers that included businessmen and politicians (e.g., a regional deputy, Vadim Gataullin, also bought in Trump Hollywood ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=Some%20of%20these%20Russian%20buyers,not%20identified%20in%20state%20records)) ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=Gataullin%20is%20from%20the%20semi,parliament%20from%202013%20until%202015))). So Yuzvik is a node in the sub-network of **Russian political figures in Trump’s Florida developments**.

His case also illustrates possible security concerns. Owning U.S. real estate could theoretically give someone like Yuzvik a foothold for other purposes (travel cover, etc.). There’s no evidence of wrongdoing, but intelligence analysts might see it as a potential vector – say, an FSB-connected person with property access in the U.S. 

In sum, Alexander Yuzvik’s purchase bolstered Trump during the recession and highlights how entwined Trump’s real estate business became with people deep inside the Russian system. While individually minor, combined with many similar cases, it meant by 2014 Trump had a **significant client base of Russian officials/execs**, an unusual situation that would raise flags once he ran for president. Yuzvik personifies that “disproportionate cross-section” of Russians in Trump’s asset base that Don Jr. spoke of ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=In%20September%202008%2C%20at%20the,the%20Trump%20Organization%27s%20business%20model)).

## Andrey Truskov

### Background & Biography
Andrey Truskov is a Russian entrepreneur known as a co-founder and co-owner of **Absolute Group, LLC**, a Moscow-based holding company with diverse interests ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=Andrey%20Truskov%2C%20another%20Trump%20condo,not%20disclose%20its%20financial%20results)). Absolute Group (sometimes stylized “Absolute”) has businesses in wholesale electronics, banking, and real estate development ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=Andrey%20Truskov%2C%20another%20Trump%20condo,not%20disclose%20its%20financial%20results)). Truskov’s career has been in building this conglomerate. One part of Absolute Group operates one of Russia’s largest electronics wholesale businesses ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=Andrey%20Truskov%2C%20another%20Trump%20condo,not%20disclose%20its%20financial%20results)), indicating Truskov is well-connected in commercial circles. He’s not publicly political; he’s more of a businessman of the Putin era who expanded into multiple sectors. There’s no known criminal record or scandal attached to his name in media, implying he’s seen as a legitimate businessman, though in Russia that often involves maintaining good relations with authorities.

### Interactions with Donald Trump
Andrey Truskov’s known interaction with Donald Trump is through a property purchase. In **2011**, Truskov bought a three-bedroom apartment (unit 1102) for $1.4 million in the **Trump Hollywood condominium in Hollywood, Florida** ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=Andrey%20Truskov%2C%20another%20Trump%20condo,not%20disclose%20its%20financial%20results)) ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=results)). This was another case of a wealthy Russian investing in a Trump-branded South Florida property. According to Reuters, Truskov acknowledged in a phone interview that he bought the condo as an investment and for personal use, noting it cost about the same as a high-end apartment in Moscow but came with the bonus of good Florida weather ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=online%20real%20estate%20listings)). He said it was purely a personal decision with no connection to his business interests ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=In%20a%20telephone%20interview%2C%20Truskov,no%20connection%20with%20his%20business)).

Truskov appears to have been a straightforward buyer. He didn’t mention any direct dealings with Trump or Trump Org officials; he likely worked via realtors or the developer’s sales team. It’s unlikely Trump met Truskov, but Trump benefited from the sale (the Trump Hollywood was a licensing deal; Trump got branding fees, and strong sales would help his royalties).

Truskov was open with Reuters about the purchase, which sets him apart from some more secretive buyers. He even later sold that apartment for a profit in 2016, showing it was indeed an investment vehicle for him ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=Some%20of%20these%20Russian%20buyers,not%20identified%20in%20state%20records)) (the Reuters piece notes he sold one of his Trump Hollywood units). 

### Financial, Criminal, or Political Connections
Financially, Andrey Truskov’s purchase is part of the nearly $100 million that Russian buyers poured into Trump Florida condos ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=As%20the%20U,100%20million%20in%20Trump%20buildings)). His role as co-owner of a large electronics and banking group means he has significant wealth. The $1.4M condo purchase was probably a small portion of his assets. He described it as diversifying: owning a place in Florida and enjoying it occasionally ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=In%20a%20telephone%20interview%2C%20Truskov,no%20connection%20with%20his%20business)).

There’s no indication of illicit funds in his case. In fact, he was one of the few who spoke on record, sounding above-board. However, as with others, his money ultimately comes from Russia’s economy which has its share of opaque practices. One might wonder if Absolute Group’s banking arm had any overlap with known money laundering (some Russian banks facilitated capital flight). But Absolute Bank was a legitimate mid-tier bank to our knowledge, not flagged like some.

Politically, Truskov is not a public political figure. Buying a foreign condo might actually contravene unwritten expectations for someone involved in banking (like, keep money at home), but as a private businessman he had more leeway than state officials. He doesn’t have known political connections aside from operating in regulated sectors (banking requires Central Bank relationships).

Interestingly, Absolute Group’s success in electronics suggests links to import networks – sometimes those can have shady sides (contraband electronics, etc.), but there’s no specific info implicating them. 

When asked, Truskov emphasized the personal nature of his Trump condo investment ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=In%20a%20telephone%20interview%2C%20Truskov,no%20connection%20with%20his%20business)). He did not hide it like Yuzvik did with his. Truskov’s openness might imply he wasn’t worried about political blowback at home.

### Broader Role in the Network
Andrey Truskov represents the **private-sector, wealthy Russian investor** piece of Trump’s network. Unlike Yuzvik (a state actor) or oligarchs like Abramovich, Truskov is a new-money capitalist who found value in a Trump asset abroad. His motivation – “Florida is nice, price was reasonable” – was likely genuine, reflecting how Trump’s brand attracted not just dirty money but also aspirational money. Many Russian businesspeople saw owning Trump condos as a status symbol or prudent investment.

Truskov’s role in the broader Trump-Russia picture is modest but illustrative. He is one data point among dozens showing how deeply Russian individuals invested in Trump properties circa 2008–2014. To Trump, people like Truskov were ideal clients: rich, low-profile, and paying cash. To an investigator, people like Truskov show how **Russian economic clout quietly seeped into Trump’s real estate**. It wasn’t all mobsters and officials; it was often regular business folks who simply trusted the stability of U.S. real estate over that of Russia.

In the network map, Truskov would connect Trump to Russia’s business community. His presence implies that news of Trump projects traveled through Moscow business circles (“Hey, there’s a great condo in Miami to buy”). In fact, there were Russia-based real estate brokers marketing Trump condos. For instance, an exhibitor at a Moscow property show in 2007 marketed Trump Miami condos, likely how Truskov or his associates heard of it. This quasi-formal network of sales ties Trump’s organization to professionals in Russia.

While Truskov likely has no political leverage, the cumulative economic stake that people like him had in Trump properties created a subtle form of influence. Trump Org would want to keep those customers happy (maintaining property values, etc.). Also, if Russian authorities ever decided to restrict capital outflow, investors like Truskov might have had to sell – potentially impacting Trump-branded property values. So indirectly, Trump’s fortunes became linked to the **financial freedom of Russian investors**.

Overall, Andrey Truskov’s broader role is being part of the *critical mass* of Russian money that buoyed Trump ventures during a lean time. His involvement underscores that Russian influence was not necessarily a top-down conspiracy but rather an organic outcome of global capital flows mixing with Trump’s aggressive marketing to Russians. By 2014, thanks to buyers like Truskov, Trump buildings in Florida were thriving even as U.S. buyers were scarce. That set a precedent and dependency which later raised serious concerns when Trump entered politics.

## Alexey Ustaev

### Background & Biography
Alexey Ustaev is a Russian banker and businessman from St. Petersburg. He is the founder and president of **Viking Bank**, one of the first private investment banks established in St. Petersburg after the fall of Communism ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=Several%20wealthy%20buyers%20were%20from,after%20the%20fall%20of%20Communism)). Viking Bank, under Ustaev, engaged in a variety of financial services and also had a charitable profile in the community – Ustaev is known to sponsor orphanages and chess clubs, and he’s received awards from the Russian Sports Ministry and the St. Petersburg Chamber of Commerce for his contributions ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=private%20investment%20banks%20established%20in,after%20the%20fall%20of%20Communism)). This paints him as a civic-minded businessman. Ustaev, born likely in the 1960s, built Viking Bank in the wild 1990s and managed to keep it running for decades. He’s not known as an oligarch; more a mid-level financier with local influence in St. Pete. He’s not publicly associated with crime or politics, though any banker in Russia often has connections by necessity to power brokers.

### Interactions with Donald Trump
Alexey Ustaev’s interaction with Donald Trump came as a **two-time condo buyer** in Trump-branded properties in Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. He first bought a 3-bedroom unit (5006) in Trump Palace for $1.2 million cash in 2009 ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=A%20donor%20to%20orphanages%20and,biography%20on%20the%20bank%E2%80%99s%20website)). Then in 2011, he upgraded, purchasing a $5.2 million penthouse in the adjacent **Trump Royale** tower ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=In%202009%2C%20Ustaev%20bought%20unit,2%20million)). These purchases, both all-cash, made him one of the more significant Russian investors in those developments by value.

Ustaev explained via email to Reuters that he bought the condos for private use and family, not as any business venture ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=In%20an%20email%20reply%20to,purposes%20or%20vacations%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said)). It’s likely he used them as vacation homes given Florida’s appeal. Possibly also as part of wealth diversification after the 2008 crisis – putting money into hard assets abroad.

He, like others, probably didn’t deal with Trump personally. The Trump towers in Sunny Isles were developed by Gil Dezer (Trump licensed his name to local developer Dezer Properties). Trump may have met big buyers at a cocktail reception or so, but there’s no report of a meeting with Ustaev. 

Ustaev’s family or representatives appear to have spent time at the properties; he responded to Reuters in a straightforward way, saying he comes to the U.S. for business or vacations and that’s why he wanted a place ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=In%20an%20email%20reply%20to,purposes%20or%20vacations%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said)).

### Financial, Criminal, or Political Connections
Financially, Ustaev’s purchases are notable in size – over $6 million invested. As a banker, he certainly had access to such funds. Viking Bank itself might have extended him credit or he simply used profits. His **philanthropic activities** and recognition indicate a degree of legitimacy; the local government lauded him rather than prosecuted him.

There’s no hint of illicit source of funds beyond the general suspicion any Russian banker might attract. Viking Bank was not internationally famous or implicated in known laundering scandals like some bigger banks. However, one cannot rule out that smaller banks also sometimes facilitate moving clients’ money abroad. If Ustaev moved money to the U.S., he as a banker would know how to do it cleanly.

Politically, Ustaev was connected in St. Petersburg’s business community (chamber of commerce awards mean ties to city officials). Nationally, not so much; he’s not an oligarch or Kremlin insider. His sports ministry award suggests he funded sports events or teams. That could indicate he’s in good favor with authorities to get those public acknowledgments.

One thing: Ustaev’s nondisclosure of his Trump condos wasn’t an issue because as a private banker, he didn’t have to file public declarations like officials do. So he’s different from Yuzvik or Gataullin who were obliged to declare assets.

He told Reuters he didn’t want to comment on his family’s U.S. business, and emphasized his life is in Russia ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=In%20an%20email%20reply%20to,purposes%20or%20vacations%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said)). This modest stance suggests he wasn’t trying to draw attention.

### Broader Role in the Network
Alexey Ustaev’s presence in Trump’s network underscores the **attraction Trump’s brand had for Russia’s business elite**. Ustaev is part of the St. Petersburg set – interestingly, St. Petersburg is Putin’s hometown and has a tight-knit elite. Though we have no evidence Putin knows Ustaev, it’s interesting that multiple buyers (Ustaev, and e.g., Oleg Misevra is from the Far East but got praise from Putin) come from regional elites. It shows the Trump condos were popular among various strata of Russia’s wealthy, not just Moscow billionaires.

By 2014, Ustaev’s penthouse purchase and presence in Trump Royale added to Trump’s reliance on foreign nationals for his condo sales. Reuters found **63 Russian passport holders** bought in Trump buildings ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=As%20the%20U,100%20million%20in%20Trump%20buildings)) – Ustaev was among the top tier by spending. For Trump’s business, these folks were crucial: during the late 2000s housing bust, Americans weren’t buying luxury condos, so Russians like Ustaev kept the towers occupied and prices stable.

In the larger geopolitical sense, Ustaev and peers inadvertently gave Russia some soft leverage. If, say, Russian authorities pressured their businessmen to repatriate assets, a bunch of Trump condo sales could occur simultaneously, hurting the Trump brand’s aura of exclusivity. Conversely, as long as ties with Russia were good, that money stayed put.

For network mapping, Ustaev links Trump’s brand to the financial community of St. Petersburg. In St. Pete, Viking Bank’s sphere likely intersects with other prominent figures possibly connected to Putin (for example, oligarchs like Gennady Timchenko or Yuri Kovalchuk operate there, though not saying Ustaev ties to them, but he’s in that ecosystem). This again weaves Trump into Russia’s socio-economic fabric beyond just oligarchs.

Ustaev also shows how **state-linked individuals and private businessmen often mingle** – he received awards from officials, bridging civic life and private wealth. In the Trump network, he sits alongside both categories of Russians.

In summary, Alexey Ustaev’s broader role is as a **representative of Russia’s respectable banking class investing in Trump’s product**. It exemplifies that not all Russian money in Trump ventures was shady or hidden – some was quite above-board from established people. Yet, cumulatively, it still meant Trump’s fortunes were intertwined with the fortunes of these Russian individuals. Should something systemically affect Russian wealth (sanctions, economic downturn), it would affect Trump’s customer base. Thus, Ustaev and others inadvertently made Trump **economically sensitive to Russia’s situation**. This interdependence is a key point when assessing how Trump’s views on Russia might be formed by business interests.

## Oleg Misevra

### Background & Biography
Oleg Misevra is a coal mining magnate and former regional politician from Russia’s Far East. A one-time **traffic police commander** turned businessman, Misevra built a coal empire on Sakhalin Island (a resource-rich region) ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=Many%20of%20the%20Russian%20buyers,and%20answer%20session%20with%20him)). He chairs the board of a company called “Eastern Mining Company” (VGK), which is a major producer of coal on Sakhalin. Misevra gained prominence locally and caught the attention of national leaders: in 2010, Vladimir Putin publicly praised Misevra’s company’s work and engaged with him in a Q&A at a regional United Russia party meeting ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=Many%20of%20the%20Russian%20buyers,and%20answer%20session%20with%20him)) ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=company%E2%80%99s%20main%20assets%20are%20in,and%20answer%20session%20with%20him)). This indicates Misevra was politically well-connected, at least regionally. He also served as a deputy in the Sakhalin regional Duma (parliament) or had a similar political role (Reuters labeled him a “local politician” from Bashkortostan as well ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=Some%20of%20these%20Russian%20buyers,not%20identified%20in%20state%20records))—possibly he had moved or had multiple regional ties, this part is a bit confusing in sources, but clearly he’s been in public service). He is considered part of Russia’s broader “elite”, though not a household name in Moscow.

### Interactions with Donald Trump
Oleg Misevra’s link to Donald Trump is via a **luxury penthouse purchase**. In 2010, a corporation controlled by Misevra (called “Swiss Residence Aliance Inc”) bought the Penthouse #1 in Trump Hollywood, Florida for $6.8 million ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=Misevra%2C%20a%20wealthy%20coal%20magnate,held%20a%20lengthy%20question%20and)). This unit was an expansive 8,200 sq. ft. duplex with ocean views, a crown jewel of the building ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=A%20corporation%20Misevra%20controls%2C%20Swiss,respond%20to%20requests%20for%20comment)). The purchase through an offshore company masked Misevra’s personal name on U.S. property records, but Reuters uncovered he was behind it. This transaction was one of the largest in that building.

There’s no evidence Misevra interacted with Trump personally in this deal. It was likely facilitated by brokers and possibly attorneys given it was via an offshore entity. It’s unclear if he ever visited the property, but presumably it was for personal use or a trophy asset. By buying through a BVI or Panamanian company (just guessing the jurisdiction from the name “Swiss Residence Aliance”), he kept it low-profile.

Misevra did not respond to requests for comment by Reuters ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=A%20corporation%20Misevra%20controls%2C%20Swiss,respond%20to%20requests%20for%20comment)). The penthouse’s presence in his portfolio was also not disclosed in Russian records (like Yuzvik, he didn’t list it on any public forms given he was a deputy in Bashkortostan’s legislature until 2015 ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=Gataullin%20is%20from%20the%20semi,parliament%20from%202013%20until%202015))). That suggests secrecy.

### Financial, Criminal, or Political Connections
Financially, Oleg Misevra had the means via coal profits to afford a $6.8M penthouse. But the **use of an offshore company** hints at either privacy concerns or something more. It could be to avoid Russian taxes or scrutiny (since officials are often expected not to have foreign luxuries). It also emphasizes how common it was for foreign buyers at that level to use shell companies (which complicates due diligence – Trump Org might not have known who the ultimate buyer was unless they asked, which they might not as long as money came).

As a coal businessman, he likely had run-ins with the typical issues in Russian extractive industries – possibly environmental controversies or labor disputes – but he isn’t publicly known for criminal actions. Politically, his being part of United Russia events and a regional parliament indicates he’s part of Putin’s ruling party structure, at least at a local level. That ties him indirectly to the Kremlin (through party hierarchy).

One strong political connection: Putin *personally praised* Misevra in 2010 ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=Many%20of%20the%20Russian%20buyers,and%20answer%20session%20with%20him)). That’s a big deal, implying trust or at least approval from the top. Possibly, Misevra’s coal helped fuel something crucial or he kept a strategic industry alive in a remote region. After that, he asked Putin a question in that meeting, showing familiarity. These details suggest he’s in the orbit of those who have Putin’s ear.

Criminally, if any, could be the usual corruption. The Reuters piece notes he’s been sanctioned (the Night Wolves motorcycle gang leader was one he posed with, which is interesting because that gang is sanctioned for Crimea involvement ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida#:~:text=The%20buyers%20include%20politically%20connected,in%20banking%2C%20property%20and%20electronics)) – not sure if Misevra had link to them beyond a photo). Nothing direct on him though.

He did not respond to Reuters, so he wasn’t eager to talk about his Florida asset, possibly fearing questions on how he got money out of Russia or why he hid it from declarations.

### Broader Role in the Network
Oleg Misevra stands out in Trump’s network as a **member of the Russian regional political elite** converting some of his wealth into a Trump property. His involvement underscores that not only Moscow oligarchs but also influential figures from across Russia were investing in Trump’s real estate. He was arguably the most politically connected of the Florida condo buyers identified (since he had a governmental role). 

This broadens the scope of Trump’s entanglements: it’s not just private capital but also quasi-public figures with ties to Putin who had a stake in Trump-branded assets. That raises potential for future leverage or conflict: for instance, if Putin’s regime knew that a Sakhalin politico held a secret Trump penthouse, that’s information they have (and the West only learned later). They could blackmail or direct Misevra regarding that asset if needed (e.g., “donate it to the state, or use the resale to funnel money”).

Also, network-wise, Misevra connects Trump to the **United Russia party network**. He directly interacted with Putin at least once. So one could conceive a link: Trump <- property -> Misevra <- Putin. It’s a couple degrees of separation but notable.

The fact that neither Misevra nor Yuzvik disclosed their Trump properties domestically was pointed out by Reuters as showing how Russians were secreting assets abroad ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Another%20politically,100%20million%20in%20Trump%20buildings)). This speaks to capital flight and possibly illegally siphoned funds ending up in Trump developments – precisely the sort of thing that worries financial watchdogs.

In Trump’s larger Russia web, Misevra’s case exemplifies the **convergence of money and politics**. He wasn’t just rich; he was part of the governing apparatus. Thus, his presence links Trump real estate to the Russian state apparatus in a way most other buyers didn’t. It's a subtle link, but imagine in a scenario analysis: if Putin wanted to influence Trump pre-presidency, he could conceivably ask loyalists like Misevra to do something with their Trump assets (like create a financial problem or raise a stink). Conversely, Trump’s treatment of buyers like Misevra (keep them happy, property values up) could reflect in his attitude toward Russia—maintaining good relations keeps those investors content.

In summary, Oleg Misevra’s broader role was as part of a pipeline by which **post-Soviet regional power players’ money ended up supporting Trump ventures**. He adds to how extensive and high-level the network of Trump’s Russian customers was. The Sakhalin coal boss with Putin’s praise owning a Trump penthouse is a striking illustration of Trump’s brand penetration into the far reaches of the Russian elite.

## Alexander Shnaider

### Background & Biography
Alexander Shnaider is a Canadian businessman of Soviet-born origins. Born in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) in 1968 to a Jewish family, Shnaider emigrated to Canada as a teenager. He made his fortune in the 1990s through trading and manufacturing deals in the former Soviet Union, often in partnership with his mentor Boris Birshtein. Shnaider’s big break was co-founding the **Midland Group**, which purchased a steel mill in Ukraine (Zaporizhstal) and later sold it for a large profit around 2010 ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=There%20is%20evidence%20that%20Russian,Business%20Insider)). With this wealth, Shnaider diversified – he even briefly owned a Formula One racing team (Midland F1) and invested in real estate. He’s best known in Trump circles as the developer of **Trump International Hotel & Tower Toronto**. Though not a household name, Shnaider was among the richer Canadians and had connections across the post-Soviet business world. He has no criminal record, but his ventures often intersected with controversial figures (Birshtein was alleged to have Russian mob ties; Shnaider dealt with Russian state bank VEB, etc.). Politically, Shnaider wasn’t active, but as a global businessman he rubbed shoulders with officials in Russia, Ukraine, and Canada.

### Interactions with Donald Trump
Alexander Shnaider’s primary interaction with Donald Trump was as a **business partner (licensee)**. Shnaider’s company, Talon International, built a 65-story tower in Toronto which they branded **Trump International Hotel & Tower** (opened in 2012). Trump had no equity in the project but licensed his name and managed the hotel/condo operations for a fee ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Though%20Trump%20had%20no%20equity,Business%20Insider)). Ivanka Trump negotiated much of that deal with Shnaider in mid-2000s. During development, Shnaider and Trump appeared together at launch events, and Shnaider spoke positively of the partnership (the Trump brand was used to market units at premium prices). 

However, by around 2013, the Toronto project was struggling financially (many units unsold, debt heavy). It’s here a notable transaction occurred: In 2010, Shnaider sold his stake in a Ukrainian steel mill for $850 million, and reportedly **directed $15 million of that to help finish the Trump Toronto project** ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=There%20is%20evidence%20that%20Russian,Business%20Insider)). The buyer of the steel mill was **Vnesheconombank (VEB)** – a Russian state development bank chaired by Putin ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Ukraine%20steel%20plant%20to%20the,Business%20Insider)). This effectively meant Russian state-linked money went into completing Trump Toronto ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=There%20is%20evidence%20that%20Russian,Business%20Insider)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=state%20development%20bank%20whose%20supervisory,Business%20Insider)). Trump wasn’t an investor, but the success of the project protected his brand’s reputation and fees. 

It’s not clear if Trump was aware of the funding specifics. But Shnaider’s deal with VEB to sell the mill and use proceeds for the tower could have been mentioned to Trump Org if, say, they asked about construction delays or financing. In any case, Trump benefited indirectly.

Shnaider’s interactions with the Trump family were substantial in the project phase. Ivanka frequently visited Toronto for it. Donald Trump would have interacted with Shnaider at grand opening events in 2012. After completion, the building fell into bankruptcy (by 2016). It was eventually sold off and the Trump name removed in 2017 – but all that is after Shnaider’s involvement. Up to 2014, Shnaider was the owner-operator and Trump’s partner in the property.

### Financial, Criminal, or Political Connections
Financially, Shnaider was a conduit for Russian state capital into a Trump-branded project without Trump’s direct knowledge perhaps. His deal with VEB is telling: VEB is often used by the Kremlin to advance strategic interests abroad. The timing (2010) suggests it may have been partly to ingratiate with Canada or with Trump (though more likely Shnaider just needed to cash out of steel and Putin’s Russia wanted more control of Ukraine’s industry). Regardless, **$15 million of Putin-chaired bank money** propped up a Trump project ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Ukraine%20steel%20plant%20to%20the,Business%20Insider)). That’s a solid link in the chain of Russian entanglements.

No criminal activity on Shnaider’s part is known. However, Canadian media noted the **Birshtein connection** (Birshtein, Shnaider’s early partner, was investigated for mob ties and was mentioned in FBI reports). Shnaider himself hasn’t been charged.

Politically, Shnaider moved in interesting circles. In 2006 he attended Putin’s 50th birthday party – a sign of some closeness or at least being on a guest list, as reported by his ex-partner ([Business projects of Donald Trump in Russia - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_projects_of_Donald_Trump_in_Russia#:~:text=Business%20projects%20of%20Donald%20Trump,to%20later%20Trump%20Moscow%20talks)). Also, VEB’s head at the time was Igor Shuvalov (Putin’s aide). So Shnaider had high-level access in Moscow. In Canada, he donated to some politicians but stayed mostly apolitical publicly.

One notable point: In early 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported that **Shnaider was in talks to sell Trump Toronto during 2015–2016 and one potential buyer was a mystery Russian state-backed entity**. Shnaider claimed a broker told him a Russian firm might pay above market, and he suspected it might be to influence Trump (since Trump was running for president by then) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=state%20development%20bank%20whose%20supervisory,Business%20Insider)). Shnaider did not pursue that buyer. This anecdote, if true, indicates intelligence interest: Russian state might have considered overpaying to channel money to Trump via Shnaider’s building. That never transpired, but it shows Shnaider’s asset was seen as a possible way to funnel value to Trump.

### Broader Role in the Network
Alexander Shnaider’s role in Trump’s network is as a **foreign partner who brought in Russian state money to support a Trump-branded venture**. He is an example of how indirect the entanglements can be: a Canadian developer uses Putin’s bank to salvage a Trump tower. That creates a hidden dependency of Trump’s business on Putin’s favor (through VEB financing). It is a textbook case of how “Russian state-linked capital reached Trump projects via intermediaries” ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=There%20is%20evidence%20that%20Russian,Business%20Insider)).

In a network map, Shnaider connects Trump to VEB/Putin. It’s like Trump -> Shnaider -> Putin (via VEB). This link became part of the public narrative when it was revealed in 2017, reinforcing concerns that Putin’s government had quietly cultivated Trump via business ties long before politics.

Shnaider also illustrates the global aspect: he isn’t Russian (by nationality now), he’s a Canadian. But because of his origins and business, he served as a bridge for Russian influence to slip into North America. The Senate Intelligence Committee likely examined this case in their report’s financial section.

Additionally, Shnaider’s willingness to talk (he confirmed the VEB detail to media) provided rare direct evidence of Russian government money propping up a Trump venture ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Ukraine%20steel%20plant%20to%20the,Business%20Insider)). In the timeline up to 2014, by that year Trump Toronto was open and depending on Shnaider’s infusion to keep afloat, which had come from VEB (a sanctioned bank later).

Therefore, Shnaider’s broader role is being a **vector for Kremlin-connected financing** in Trump’s business network, without which Trump Toronto might have failed mid-construction (which would have been a blow to the brand). It also highlights how **enmeshed Trump became with post-Soviet oligarchic circles**: through Shnaider, Trump indirectly partnered with Ukrainian and Russian interests.

In summary, Alexander Shnaider was a key facilitator who not only expanded Trump’s brand into Canada but did so with the backing of Russian state funds. This adds a significant piece to the mosaic of Trump’s deepening Russian entanglements in the 2001–2014 period.

## Aras Agalarov

### Background & Biography
Aras Agalarov is an Azerbaijani-born Russian real estate developer and billionaire, often called the “Trump of Russia” for his flashy building projects. Born in 1955 in Baku (then Soviet Azerbaijan), Agalarov moved to Moscow and founded the **Crocus Group**, a development firm. He made his fortune building shopping malls, exhibition centers (like Crocus Expo), and high-end housing in Russia. By the 2010s, Agalarov was a prominent figure in Moscow’s business elite, known to be close to the Kremlin. In 2013, Putin awarded him the **Order of Honor**, one of Russia’s top civilian awards ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=The%20Agalarovs%20were%20well,though%20they%20later%20divorced)), signalling high favor. Agalarov has also won large government construction contracts (e.g., for APEC summit facilities, university campuses), indicating trust from authorities ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=The%20Agalarovs%20were%20well,though%20they%20later%20divorced)). Politically, he’s not an office-holder but leverages connections; he’s well-connected to Putin’s circle. He’s married (his wife heads their Crocus City Hall concert venue) and his son Emin Agalarov is a pop singer and vice-president of Crocus Group. Aras is suave, Western-friendly (he tried to bring Vegas-style entertainment to Moscow), and cultivated ties with international figures like Trump.

### Interactions with Donald Trump
Aras Agalarov was one of Donald Trump’s most significant Russian business partners leading up to 2014. Their relationship took off when Agalarov hosted the **Miss Universe 2013 pageant in Moscow**, which Trump co-owned. It began earlier in 2013: Aras and his son **Emin Agalarov** met Trump at the Miss USA pageant in Las Vegas in June 2013 ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Trump%27s%20most%20significant%20business%20venture,POLITICO)). Over dinner with music promoter Rob Goldstone, they struck a deal for Agalarov to bring Miss Universe to Moscow that November ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=In%20June%202013%2C%20Trump%20dined,Linked%20Transactions%20From%20the)). Agalarov agreed to pay roughly **$20 million** for the rights and production costs ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=In%20June%202013%2C%20Trump%20dined,Linked%20Transactions%20From%20the)), a huge sum that likely made Trump a nice profit. This payment was routed through complex means (a Swiss bank account and a Delaware shell company) as reported later ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Moscow%20Tower%20Problem%20,Center%20for%20American%20Progress)).

During the pageant event in Moscow (Nov 2013), Aras Agalarov interacted closely with Trump. He hosted Trump at Crocus City Hall (his venue) for the show ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=The%20Miss%20Universe%20pageant%20took,Miss%20Universe%20to%20Moscow)). He threw a lavish after-party, attended by many Russian businessmen and celebrities (Trump noted “all the oligarchs” were in the room) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=During%20his%20visit%20to%20Moscow%2C,WNYC%20Studios)). Although Putin did not attend, Aras delivered to Trump a gift and note from Putin (a symbol of high-level attention) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Trump%27s%20public%20overtures%20to%20Vladimir,POLITICO)). Trump publicly praised the Agalarovs as “one of the great families of Russia” ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=itself%20but%20about%20building%20relationships,POLITICO)) and expressed desire to do more ventures together.

Indeed, after Miss Universe, in late 2013 and into 2014, Trump and Agalarov explored building a **Trump Tower Moscow** together. They scouted sites (one near Crocus City property), drew up preliminary plans, and discussed financing ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Throughout%20his%20Moscow%20visit%2C%20Trump,Wikipedia)). Donald Jr. said the deal “died of deal fatigue” by end of 2014, partly due to the Ukraine crisis sanctions climate dampening Western-Russian business ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=The%20proposed%20Trump%20Tower%20Moscow,WNYC%20Studios)). But the intent was serious; a letter of intent may have been signed (later a separate Trump Tower Moscow effort in 2015 came with Michael Cohen, but the 2013–14 Agalarov attempt was an earlier iteration).

So by 2014, Aras Agalarov had become probably **Trump’s closest partner in Russia**. They exchanged personal gifts (Agalarov gave Trump a painting of Trump). Emails released later showed they maintained correspondence into 2015 and 2016 – Aras attempted to help arrange the infamous June 2016 meeting offering “dirt” on Clinton, via Emin and Goldstone. That shows the personal rapport built in 2013 was ongoing.

### Financial, Criminal, or Political Connections
Financially, Aras Agalarov put significant resources toward Trump-related ventures: the $20 million pageant deal was huge ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=In%20June%202013%2C%20Trump%20dined,Linked%20Transactions%20From%20the)). He likely recouped some via sponsorships and ticket sales, but it was partly a prestige play. He also stood ready to invest hundreds of millions in a Trump Moscow tower had it proceeded. For Trump, Agalarov was a dream partner – deep-pocketed and politically connected.

Agalarov’s Kremlin ties are strong. The **Order of Honor from Putin** underscores that ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=The%20Agalarovs%20were%20well,though%20they%20later%20divorced)). Crocus Group got big state contracts (e.g., building Far Eastern Federal University campus for an APEC summit, and infrastructure for the World Cup later). Such reliance on state contracts means Aras is at Putin’s mercy to a degree and likely cooperative. That suggests if Putin wanted to channel something to Trump, Aras could be a willing conduit.

Criminal wise, Agalarov is not known to be involved in crime; instead he’s part of the sanctioned circle by virtue of being a wealthy Russian. In 2018, the U.S. Treasury named him on the “Oligarch list.” He has not been personally sanctioned as of 2014, but after 2014, Crocus Group projects might have been impacted by sanctions on the Russian economy.

Politically, Aras is an informal diplomat of sorts. By hosting Miss Universe, he further ingratiated with the regime (promoting Russia as open for big events). He also had his own political asks – he tried to build a relationship with Trump in case Trump became influential in U.S.-Russia relations (which indeed happened, beyond what anyone expected). The fact the Agalarovs triggered the Trump Tower meeting in 2016 shows they were acting with a political motive by then (likely at least partially at the Kremlin’s behest to offer help to Trump’s campaign).

One could say by 2014, Aras Agalarov became a nexus of **business and political links between Trump and the Kremlin**. It’s notable the Senate Intelligence Committee report devotes space to the Agalarov relationship as a key lead-up to 2016.

### Broader Role in the Network
Aras Agalarov’s broader role was **Trump’s gateway to doing real business in Russia**. He was the first and only major Russian developer to bring Trump to Moscow for an actual event, and nearly for a tower. This made the prospect of a Trump Tower Moscow tangible, something Trump had dreamed of since the 1980s. If not for world events, they might have built it.

In network terms, Agalarov connects Trump directly to Putin’s inner circle. Through Aras and Emin, Trump indirectly communicated with Putin (the gift & note in 2013) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Trump%27s%20public%20overtures%20to%20Vladimir,POLITICO)). The Agalarovs also connect Trump to Russian pop culture and society (Emin’s celebrity), broadening the influence network beyond pure politics.

Agalarov also represents how foreign networks can pivot into political influence: he seamlessly moved from “business partner” in 2013 to attempting to broker political favors in 2016. This indicates the network ties formed earlier were later leveraged for potentially covert political assistance, confirming U.S. intel fears that seemingly benign business ties can be vectors for foreign influence.

By 2014, Aras Agalarov effectively was the **anchor of Trump’s Russia connections**. Other connections (Bayrock, condo buyers) were somewhat one-step removed, but Agalarov was dealing directly with Trump on major endeavors. Their families socialized (Ivanka was friendly with Emin’s then-wife, who was Azerbaijan President Aliyev’s daughter – small world). 

When Trump came home from Moscow 2013 praising Putin and tweeting asking if Putin would be his “new best friend,” it was after being lavishly hosted by Agalarov ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=During%20his%20visit%20to%20Moscow%2C,WNYC%20Studios)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Trump%27s%20public%20overtures%20to%20Vladimir,POLITICO)). So Aras had successfully wooed Trump by appealing to his ego and business aspirations. This set the stage for Trump’s remarkably positive stance on Russia starting then, which many noticed.

In summary, Aras Agalarov’s role in Trump’s network is pivotal: he was the **key Russian interlocutor** for Trump, merging business and political worlds. Through lavish hospitality and lucrative deals, he tied Trump closer to Russia than ever before. His involvement exemplifies the culmination of Trump’s deepening entanglements: by 2014, Trump had a *quasi-ally* in Moscow’s elite, something he’d long sought. This would have profound implications as Trump moved toward a presidential run.

## Emin Agalarov

### Background & Biography
Emin Agalarov, commonly known just as “Emin,” is the son of Aras Agalarov. Born in 1979 in Baku, Azerbaijan, he was raised partly in Russia and educated in Switzerland and the U.S. (he attended high school in New Jersey). Emin wears two hats: he’s a businessman (Vice President of Crocus Group, handling entertainment properties like Crocus City Hall) and a pop singer-songwriter who has a significant following in Russia. He was married to Leyla Aliyeva (the daughter of Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev) from 2006 until their divorce in 2015 ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=brought%20Miss%20Universe%20to%20Moscow,though%20they%20later%20divorced)), linking him to Azeri political dynasty. Charismatic and Westernized, Emin was instrumental in connecting his father with Donald Trump for Miss Universe 2013. He often acted as the liaison – emailing Goldstone and the Trumps. Post-2014, Emin gained international notoriety for his part in setting up the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting. But in 2001–2014, he was mostly known as a pop star who happened to be a developer’s son.

### Interactions with Donald Trump
Emin Agalarov’s interactions with Donald Trump grew out of the Miss Universe partnership. It was Emin (as a singer who had performed at Miss Universe 2012) who initially pushed his father Aras to pursue hosting Miss Universe in Moscow, as per interviews. In June 2013, Emin performed at Miss USA in Vegas, during which he and his father met Trump ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Trump%27s%20most%20significant%20business%20venture,POLITICO)). Trump was impressed by Emin’s fame and the Agalarovs’ hospitality.

In the lead-up to Miss Universe Moscow (Nov 2013), Emin corresponded often with the Trump Organization – planning events, etc. During the pageant telecast, Emin performed as a musical act on stage, and a pre-taped comedy skit aired where Donald Trump himself appeared firing Emin (a playful cameo) ([Who is Felix Sater? Trump's Russian ex-Real Estate Partner ... - Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-russia-felix-sater-real-estate-632690#:~:text=Who%20is%20Felix%20Sater%3F%20Trump%27s,former%20Soviet%20official%20Tevfik%20Arif)). This indicates a friendly rapport – Trump was game to joke around in Emin’s music context. After the pageant, at the gala, Trump and Emin were photographed together, and Trump publicly called Emin a big music star.

Importantly, Emin formed ties with the Trump children too, particularly Ivanka (they were around the same age and likely interacted at events). Socially, the Trumps and Agalarovs mingled in Moscow’s nightlife during the pageant weekend. Trump even said at the time he might like to feature Emin in a music venture or help his career in the West.

After 2013, Emin kept in touch. In 2015, when Trump announced his presidential run, it was Emin (and Goldstone) who emailed Don Jr. in June 2016 to set up a meeting promising Russian “dirt” on Clinton – stating it was on behalf of his father and “Russia’s Crown prosecutor.” That infamous meeting (though beyond 2014) underscores that by then, Emin felt comfortable contacting the Trumps for a politically sensitive purpose, leveraging the relationship built earlier.

In short, by 2014 Emin was both a friend to the Trump family and an eager potential collaborator (for Trump Moscow tower promotion and such – indeed, during the tower talks, it was often Emin’s project to push). Donald Jr. communicated with Emin about site scouting, and Emin sent pictures of possible locations, etc., in Dec 2013/Jan 2014, per congressional testimony references ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Throughout%20his%20Moscow%20visit%2C%20Trump,Wikipedia)).

### Financial, Criminal, or Political Connections
Financially, Emin’s role directly was smaller – his father was the financier. However, he possibly contributed to the Miss Universe fee from his division (or at least oversaw the spending in his concert venue). Emin likely invested some of his own effort and brand into the partnership. He certainly benefited in exposure: performing on an international stage and featuring Trump in his music video raised his profile.

No criminal ties – Emin is generally seen as a legitimate artist/businessman. Politically, through marriage to Leyla Aliyeva, Emin was linked to Azerbaijan’s ruling family, but he mostly lived in Moscow. That connection shows how networked the Agalarovs were: they had ties to both Putin and another country’s president. Emin’s divorce in 2015 possibly freed him from any constraints there.

During Trump’s campaign, Emin and Goldstone acted somewhat in a political capacity, passing messages from Russian officials to Trump’s team (the offer for the meeting said it was “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump”). It’s been reported that it was Emin’s idea to convey damaging info via Goldstone, possibly at his father’s behest.

So by 2016, Emin had turned from just a pop star friend into a backchannel contact – that’s political. But until 2014, he wasn’t doing overtly political things aside from being the son-in-law of a president and the son of a oligarch (which in itself means he’s intimately familiar with political power structures).

### Broader Role in the Network
Emin Agalarov’s broader role in Trump’s network is as the **social glue and communications conduit**. He was much more fluent in Western culture and English than his father, so he handled a lot of communication with the Trumps. His celebrity and charm helped endear the Trump family. Essentially, he made the Trump-Agalarov alliance also a youthful friendship. For example, he and Don Jr. were close enough that in 2014, Don Jr. traveled to Moscow and spent time with Emin (Don Jr. even appears briefly in a music video of Emin’s shot in Moscow).

Emin also extended Trump’s network into entertainment media in Russia. Through him, Trump met people like Russian pop diva Alsou, got exposure on Russian TV beyond news (Miss Universe broadcast had millions of Russian viewers on NBC’s Russian partner). That made Trump a known figure among Russia’s urban populace, possibly boosting his ego and interest in more ventures there.

Network-wise, Emin connected the Trumps to younger Russian elites and socialites – a different circle than the staid oligarchs. That broadens the web of personal ties (which is why, for example, when Ivanka visited Moscow pre-2014, she hung out with emin’s then-wife Leyla Aliyeva; these are second-generation elite relationships being forged).

In the timeline culminating 2014, Emin was pivotal in trying to get Trump Tower Moscow off ground – he exchanged plans and communications with the Trump Org. Even though it stalled, the groundwork was laid such that when Trump ran for office, Emin felt comfortable contacting them about sensitive matters. This indicates an unusual closeness.

In summary, Emin Agalarov’s role was being the **friendly face and direct line** between the Trump circle and the Agalarov/Putin circle. If Aras was the power broker, Emin was the personable intermediary who could call Don Jr. directly. This two-tier approach (father and son) made the Agalarov-Trump connection especially resilient and multi-faceted – business, entertainment, and eventually political messaging. Thus, Emin was crucial in maintaining and activating that network link when needed.

## Rob Goldstone

### Background & Biography
Rob Goldstone is a British-born music publicist and former journalist. In the 2000s, he co-founded a PR firm and eventually became the publicist for Emin Agalarov, Aras Agalarov’s son. Goldstone, born in 1960, had a career that included work for newspapers (he was a tabloid reporter) and later doing publicity for celebrities. By 2013, he was representing Emin and helping promote his music internationally. Goldstone is known for his gregarious, flamboyant personality (often wearing colorful hats). He was instrumental in outreach and communications when the Agalarovs interacted with the Trumps, given his English skills and media savvy. He has no involvement in crime or politics outside of the context of the Trump-Russia saga.

### Interactions with Donald Trump
Rob Goldstone’s key interactions with Donald Trump occurred as part of the Agalarov-Trump dealings. He was the one who initially emailed the Miss Universe organization in June 2013 to express the Agalarovs’ interest in hosting the pageant in Moscow (he wrote to Paula Shugart, Miss Universe president). At the Miss USA pageant in Vegas 2013, Goldstone was at the dinner where Donald Trump, Aras, and Emin hashed out the Miss Universe Moscow agreement ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=In%20June%202013%2C%20Trump%20dined,Linked%20Transactions%20From%20the)). Goldstone’s presence smoothed communications.

During Miss Universe 2013 in Moscow, Goldstone served as a kind of handler for Trump and the Agalarovs, coordinating press events. He even arranged for Trump to appear in Emin’s music video filmed during that time. Goldstone spent considerable time with Trump that weekend and later recounted that Trump talked about possibly building in Moscow with the Agalarovs – Goldstone said Trump told Aras: “Let’s build a Trump Tower here,” to which Aras was receptive (this was corroborated in Goldstone’s book).

Post-pageant, Goldstone maintained contact. Most famously, it was Goldstone who emailed Donald Trump Jr. on June 3, 2016, relaying Emin Agalarov’s message offering “official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary” as part of Russian government support for Trump ([Did Ivanka Trump And Jared Kushner Meet A Putin-Connected Russian Oligarch In Aspen? | IBTimes](https://www.ibtimes.com/did-ivanka-trump-jared-kushner-meet-putin-connected-russian-oligarch-aspen-2515668#:~:text=Abramovich%20has%20ties%20to%20the,at%20the%20first%20daughter%27s%20request)). Goldstone arranged the subsequent Trump Tower meeting on June 9, 2016, attending it himself with the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. Though outside our 2014 cutoff, it shows how Goldstone acted as a **go-between** connecting the Agalarovs and Trumps, even on explosive political matters.

Up to 2014, Goldstone’s role was primarily as an intermediary in business/entertainment contexts. He likely was emailing back and forth with the Trump Org staff on behalf of the Agalarovs about the potential Trump Moscow project in 2014.

### Financial, Criminal, or Political Connections
Financially, Goldstone wasn’t investing money; he was paid by Agalarov for PR services. He did gain in profile through the Trump connection – after 2013, representing Emin and being tangentially involved with Trump boosted his clout.

Criminally, Goldstone did nothing illegal in 2013-2014. He became entangled in the Mueller investigation due to the 2016 meeting he brokered, but he cooperated fully (Mueller did not charge him, likely viewing him as naive or an unwitting participant in potentially illicit outreach).

Politically, prior to 2016 Goldstone wasn’t political. However, by carrying that “dirt on Hillary” message, he was acting in a political capacity on behalf of a foreign interest. At the time (June 2016) he claims he thought it was a typical opposition research offer and didn’t grasp the ramifications. But the fact the Agalarovs trusted Goldstone to convey that message indicates by 2016 he had proven to be a reliable channel to the Trumps.

As of 2014, Goldstone had become a friendly acquaintance of the Trump family through the pageant. He took selfies with Trump, etc. But he was not an insider to Trump’s business deals beyond coordinating intros and messages for the Agalarovs.

### Broader Role in the Network
Rob Goldstone’s broader role is the **facilitator and messenger**. In the Trump-Russia network, he is the person who can translate between cultures: he understood what would entice Don Jr. (he phrased the Clinton info as “part of Russia’s support” knowing it would get attention) ([Did Ivanka Trump And Jared Kushner Meet A Putin-Connected Russian Oligarch In Aspen? | IBTimes](https://www.ibtimes.com/did-ivanka-trump-jared-kushner-meet-putin-connected-russian-oligarch-aspen-2515668#:~:text=Abramovich%20has%20ties%20to%20the,at%20the%20first%20daughter%27s%20request)), and he conveyed what the Agalarovs wanted in terms the Trumps would respond to. In 2013, he facilitated the initial trust – Trump saw Goldstone was making things happen (pageant, PR buzz), so Goldstone became a known quantity.

Goldstone effectively bridges the Trump inner circle and the Agalarov/Kremlin inner circle. Without Goldstone, the meeting request might not have been made so explicitly or accepted so readily. He gave it an air of informality (“I can just email Don Jr. directly”).

Up to 2014, Goldstone was more of a network node connecting entertainment and business realms: he got Miss Universe to Moscow (a huge network link achievement), linking Trump’s organization to Aras’ organization with a multi-million-dollar project which then spawned more interactions.

He’s also an example of a **Western conduit** that Russian interests used to reach Trump. A British citizen with no obvious agenda, Goldstone didn’t raise red flags to the Trumps – he wasn’t a Russian official; he was a jovial PR guy. So he had a unique position to pass messages casually that might otherwise have seemed suspicious.

In sum, Goldstone’s role was pivotal in converting the relationship formed in 2013 into actionable outreach in later years. For the period up to 2014, he helped cement the partnership and was probably privy to conversations about future Trump towers in Russia and cultivating goodwill.

Network-wise, he’s connected to Emin (node), Don Jr. (node), and via them to Aras and Trump. Goldstone may not have power or money, but as a connector, he significantly influenced the network’s activation (especially by 2016). Thus, he’s an exemplar of how informal go-betweens greased the wheels of Trump’s Russian links.

## Herman Gref

### Background & Biography
Herman Gref is a prominent Russian banker and former government official. Born in 1964, he served as Russia’s Minister of Economic Development and Trade from 2000 to 2007 under Putin. Since 2007, he has been the CEO of **Sberbank**, Russia’s largest state-owned bank. Gref is considered a relatively liberal technocrat in Putin’s circle – he modernized Sberbank and maintained international ties. He’s very much an insider, close to Putin (who entrusted him with a key financial institution). Gref often represents Russia at economic forums and was (and still is) one of the most influential finance figures in Russia. He has not been linked to crime; he’s sanctioned by the West since 2014 due to Sberbank’s ties to the Russian state, but personally he’s regarded as a respectable banker.

### Interactions with Donald Trump
Herman Gref had one noted interaction with Donald Trump: he attended the Miss Universe 2013 pageant in Moscow as a VIP guest. Donald Trump, after the event, boasted to MSNBC that “almost all of the oligarchs were in the room” ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=During%20his%20visit%20to%20Moscow%2C,WNYC%20Studios)). One specifically identified was Herman Gref, who sat with Trump at the event for some time ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=and%20political%20figures,WNYC%20Studios)). A Politico article confirmed Gref’s presence and described him as “a close Putin ally” heading Sberbank ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=and%20political%20figures,WNYC%20Studios)). 

We don’t know what direct conversation took place between Trump and Gref, but just by being there, Gref gave credence to the idea that top Russian financial circles were interested in Trump. Possibly, pleasantries or even business talk occurred; some speculated if Sberbank might finance a Trump Moscow deal. Indeed, Sberbank (under Gref) would later finance Crocus Group projects (they financed some of Agalarov’s developments), and Sberbank’s investment arm was reportedly tapped for the Agalarov-Trump tower discussion in 2014.

Beyond the pageant, no known direct interactions. However, it’s notable: **Sberbank’s investment banking arm** was involved in examining the Trump Tower Toronto debt in 2016 and possibly the Trump Tower Moscow proposals. Though Gref wouldn’t handle that personally, as CEO he’d be aware of major potential deals.

Gref’s presence in Trump’s sphere is primarily that one evening – but symbolically huge: it meant Putin’s banking chief was courting Trump’s attention. 

### Financial, Criminal, or Political Connections
Financially, Gref didn’t invest in Trump or vice versa. But his bank, Sberbank, is a powerhouse that could have financed a Trump tower in Moscow (some reports indicate that in 2013-14, the Agalarovs and Trump looked to Sberbank for funding the tower since Western banks wouldn’t after sanctions). If true, that puts Gref as a potential facilitator of future Trump projects.

Politically, Gref is a known Putin associate. For him to attend an event and cozy up to Trump signals a quasi-official outreach. It’s likely Gref’s attendance was tacitly approved by the Kremlin as a diplomatic gesture to Trump.

After 2014, Gref and Sberbank were sanctioned due to Crimea, limiting their international operations. But in 2013 there were no such barriers; he could freely interact.

Criminally, Gref is not implicated in wrongdoing – he’s largely seen as a competent banker. Some opposition figures criticize Sberbank’s complicity in Kremlin’s agenda, but that’s not personal crime.

### Broader Role in the Network
Herman Gref’s role in Trump’s network is **symbolic of high-level Kremlin interest**. If we list top Russians who met Trump, Gref is one of the highest ranking. His being “in the room” shows that Trump’s pageant wasn’t just glitz; it had geopolitical undertones with heavyweights present.

Network-wise, Gref connects Trump to Putin directly: as a “close Putin ally” ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=and%20political%20figures,WNYC%20Studios)), whatever Gref learned or felt about Trump likely went into reports to Putin. Thus Gref might have contributed to Putin’s assessment of Trump as someone worth cultivating.

If Trump Tower Moscow had progressed in 2014, Gref’s Sberbank might have financed it – forging a major financial link between Trump and Russia’s banking system (which effectively is the state). That scenario was plausible until it fell apart likely due to sanctions after early 2014.

Gref’s presence at the Miss Universe event is often cited to demonstrate how the Russian elite took note of Trump. It situates Trump among oligarchs and power-brokers socially – an unusual place for an American businessman (especially as this was before he was a politician).

In network diagrams, Gref would be a node connecting to Putin and to the Agalarovs (since presumably Aras invited him). Through Gref’s presence, one can infer Putin’s awareness and perhaps encouragement of building ties with Trump. It also indicates that if a Trump deal in Moscow needed government blessing, people like Gref were around to give it.

In sum, while Herman Gref’s direct involvement with Trump was brief, his role underscores the **penetration of Trump’s orbit by top Kremlin insiders**. It shows that by late 2013, Trump wasn’t just meeting mid-tier businessmen; he was rubbing shoulders with the likes of Gref. This elevated the significance of Trump’s Russian entanglements by orders of magnitude.

## David Geovanis

### Background & Biography
David Geovanis is a Moscow-based American businessman who has worked in Russia since the 1990s. Born in Massachusetts around 1967, Geovanis moved to Moscow in the mid-90s with a Wharton degree and initially worked for real estate mogul Bennett LeBow and Howard Lorber (both friends of Trump). He was involved in exploring Trump real estate deals in Russia as early as 1996 ([David Geovanis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Geovanis#:~:text=Geovanis%20has%20worked%20closely%20with,former%20head%20of%20%2055)) – notably, Geovanis helped organize Donald Trump’s first visit to Moscow in 1996 to scout projects ([David Geovanis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Geovanis#:~:text=Geovanis%20has%20worked%20closely%20with,former%20head%20of%20%2055)). In the 2000s, Geovanis built a career in Russian energy and real estate firms; he served on the board of the giant utility RAO UES during privatization ([David Geovanis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Geovanis#:~:text=him%20the%20potential%20building%20site,and%20the%20surrounding%20neighborhoods)). He’s rumored to have Russian citizenship (acquired 2014) ([David Geovanis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Geovanis#:~:text=Geovanis%20was%20born%20in%20Brockton,a%20Russian%20citizen%20in%202014)). Geovanis has ties to oligarch Oleg Deripaska and even worked on projects with Paul Manafort in Ukraine ([David Geovanis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Geovanis#:~:text=Geovanis%20has%20worked%20closely%20with,former%20head%20of%20%2055)). Essentially, he’s a well-connected expat in Moscow’s business circles, fluent in Russian, who has kept a low public profile. 

### Interactions with Donald Trump
David Geovanis has been described as a **Trump acquaintance and guide in Moscow**. In 1996, during Trump’s first Moscow trip, Geovanis was tasked (by his then-boss Lorber) to show Trump around potential sites ([David Geovanis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Geovanis#:~:text=Geovanis%20has%20worked%20closely%20with,former%20head%20of%20%2055)). They visited possible locations and nightlife; Geovanis thus became one of Trump’s first points of contact in Russia. 

Fast forward to **November 2013**, the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee found that during Trump’s Miss Universe visit, a person fitting Geovanis’s description was assigned to “accompany” Trump around Moscow ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=The%20U,gathered%20during%20Trump%27s%202013%20stay)). In fact, sources (like CNN) have reported that investigators asked about Geovanis regarding 2013. Geovanis was indeed in Trump’s orbit that weekend – likely introduced by the Agalarovs or mutual contacts to ensure Trump had an English-speaking “fixer” in Moscow. He attended parties and possibly could have knowledge of any unsavory incidents (kompromat) if they occurred. 

It’s rumored that Geovanis also socialized with Trump Jr. and Ivanka on their mid-2000s Moscow trips, being a nightlife guide. By 2013, Geovanis worked for an energy company but still had the connection to old Trump network via Lorber.

Geovanis’s interactions with Trump may include facilitating meetings – possibly he set up a meeting or two for Trump in 2013 with Russian businessmen or officials behind the scenes (the Senate report hints at redacted info about “escort” and possible kompromat attempts).

### Financial, Criminal, or Political Connections
Financially, Geovanis didn’t transact with Trump, but he benefited career-wise by being the go-to American for things Russian. If a Trump Tower Moscow had moved forward at any point, Geovanis likely would’ve been involved (as a local project manager or consultant). 

He’s not known to have done anything criminal. However, his name surfaced in the Mueller investigation context precisely because of his long ties to Trump and Manafort. U.S. Senate investigators in 2019 wanted to question him, suspecting he might know about Trump’s activities in Moscow or any covert contacts ([New Name to Know Escorted Trump Around Moscow in '96](https://investigaterussia.org/media/2019-02-21/new-name-know-escorted-trump-around-moscow-96#:~:text=New%20Name%20to%20Know%20Escorted,probing%20allegations%20of%20Russian)).

Politically, Geovanis isn’t a public figure, but being linked to Deripaska and Manafort means he was tangentially connected to political operations (Deripaska had political endeavors, Manafort obviously did). If Geovanis indeed got Russian citizenship in 2014, that suggests he was valued by Russia enough to grant it – could be a reward for business or an incentive to keep him around (or even to ensure his silence/loyalty? speculation).

Geovanis appears to have had some contact with Russian intelligence-adjacent individuals (just by being in that milieu), but he himself hasn’t been accused of espionage.

### Broader Role in the Network
David Geovanis serves as a **human bridge between Trump and the Russian business environment**. He embodies the continuity from Trump’s 1990s Russia explorations to the 2013 rekindling. Without someone like Geovanis, Trump’s interactions in Moscow would’ve been more arms-length; Geovanis provided on-the-ground facilitation and likely cultural translation.

In the network, Geovanis connects Trump to key American businessmen in Russia (Lorber, etc.) and to Russian oligarchic circles (Deripaska). Through Geovanis, one can trace a link from Trump to Deripaska’s orbit: indeed Geovanis worked for a Deripaska company for years ([David Geovanis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Geovanis#:~:text=Geovanis%20has%20worked%20closely%20with,former%20head%20of%20%2055)). That’s notable because Deripaska was an important figure in 2016 meddling context (Manafort’s patron). So Geovanis is like the “six degrees” person tying these groups.

During the Miss Universe event, if any kompromat (like prostitutes or deals) were attempted, Geovanis would likely know or be involved per the Senate report’s insinuation ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=The%20U,gathered%20during%20Trump%27s%202013%20stay)). Thus, he might hold secrets pertinent to Trump’s vulnerability.

He also underscores the deep roots of Trump’s Russia ties: not all were new in 2016; people like Geovanis had been interacting with Trump for decades, acting behind scenes to make things happen. The Senate described him as basically a chaperone arranged for Trump by unknown Russian sponsors ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=The%20U,gathered%20during%20Trump%27s%202013%20stay)).

Given Geovanis’s low profile, his importance was not public until investigators revealed interest. Now we understand he was a quiet but key facilitator, both in 1996 and 2013. Essentially, Geovanis’s presence signals that Trump’s visits to Russia were *managed* events – with a friendly American ensuring Trump had a good time and met useful contacts. That in itself suggests a coordinated effort by Russian partners to ingratiate Trump.

In conclusion, David Geovanis’s broader role is as a **facilitator and witness** to Trump’s Russia forays. He enhances the network by connecting disparate eras and actors: from Lorber (1996) to Agalarov (2013) to Manafort/Deripaska (2014). As such, he is a crucial thread in the tapestry of Trump’s Russian entanglements, proving continuity and intentional cultivation of Trump by certain Russian-aligned individuals over many years.
