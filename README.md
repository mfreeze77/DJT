<details><summary><strong>1970s–1980s: Early Connections and Soviet Interest</strong></summary>

- **1977 – Marriage Links to Eastern Bloc:** Donald Trump marries Ivana Zelníčková, a Czech national from communist Czechoslovakia ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=The%20timing%20of%20their%20marriage,Committee%20to%20Investigate%20Russia)). This union draws attention from Cold War intelligence agencies – Czechoslovakia’s Státní bezpečnost (StB) began surveilling the couple soon after<sup>*</sup>. Ivana’s father was pressured to report on the Trumps’ life abroad, providing Prague (and by extension Moscow) regular updates on Trump’s activities ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=Almost%20immediately%20after%20their%20wedding%2C,Radio%20Prague%20International)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=The%20StB%20files%20%E2%80%93%20stamped,Committee%20to%20Investigate%20Russia)).

- **Late 1970s – Intelligence Surveillance:** By 1978, the StB had a formal surveillance file on Ivana, noting details from the Trumps’ prenuptial agreement to Donald’s early political ambitions ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=circle%20and%20ambitions)). Throughout the 1980s, StB reports (shared with the Soviet KGB) tracked Trump, especially as rumors grew that he might pursue a U.S. presidential run in the future ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=The%20StB%20files%20%E2%80%93%20stamped,Committee%20to%20Investigate%20Russia)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=Because%20the%20StB%20often%20shared,Committee%20to%20Investigate%20Russia)). Soviet intelligence viewed Trump as a “very interesting person,” seeing potential value if he rose in American politics ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=The%20timing%20of%20their%20marriage,Committee%20to%20Investigate%20Russia)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=Because%20the%20StB%20often%20shared,Committee%20to%20Investigate%20Russia)).

- **1984 – First Notable Russian Buyer:** Soviet émigré David Bogatin, later exposed as a Russian mob figure, purchased five luxury condos in Trump Tower for $6 million cash ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=One%20early%20example%20stands%20out%3A,The%20New%20Republic)). Trump personally attended Bogatin’s closing, eager for the sale ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=Laundromat%20,The%20New%20Republic)). Authorities later revealed Bogatin was laundering money – an early case of suspect Russian cash flowing into Trump’s real estate ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=One%20early%20example%20stands%20out%3A,The%20New%20Republic)).

- **1986 – Introduction to Soviet Officials:** Trump meets Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin at a New York lunch. Dubinin enthusiastically praises Trump Tower (his “first sight” upon arriving in NYC) and flattered Trump’s ego ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=flashy%20up,POLITICO%20Magazine)). This encounter put Trump on the Kremlin’s radar as an up-and-coming businessman with potential mutual interests.

- **January 1987 – VIP Moscow Invitation:** Soviet authorities (via Dubinin) formally invite Trump to Moscow to discuss building a luxury hotel ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=The%201987%20Moscow%20Trip%20%E2%80%93,The%20Proposed%20Luxury%20Hotel)). The Soviet state tourism agency **Goscomintourist** (Intourist) – effectively an arm of the KGB – arranges an all-expenses-paid trip for Donald and Ivana Trump, including tours of potential sites near Red Square ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=In%20January%201987%2C%20Ambassador%20Dubinin,Trump%20accepted)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=as%20VIP%20guests%20of%20Goscomintourist,entertained%20lavishly%20during%20his%20stay)). The lavish treatment (fine dining, accommodations, guided meetings) is classic KGB cultivation tradecraft, aimed at winning Trump’s interest and possibly gathering “kompromat” ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=Dubinin%27s%20own%20daughter%20recounted%20that,goodwill%20and%20possibly%20gather%20kompromat)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=followed%20was%20classic%20KGB%20tradecraft%3A,goodwill%20and%20possibly%20gather%20kompromat)).

- **July 1987 – First Moscow Trip:** Trump spends several days in Moscow and Leningrad as a VIP guest of the Soviet government ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=In%20January%201987%2C%20Ambassador%20Dubinin,Trump%20accepted)). He explores a proposed hotel deal and is **“hooked” by the flattery** – Dubinin’s charm offensive “worked… like honey to a bee,” according to the ambassador’s daughter ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=The%20sequence%20of%20Trump%27s%20contacts,POLITICO%20Magazine)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=Dubinin%27s%20own%20daughter%20recounted%20that,goodwill%20and%20possibly%20gather%20kompromat)). Upon returning, Trump begins speaking highly of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and the potential for U.S.-Soviet friendship ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=The%201987%20Moscow%20Trip%20%E2%80%93,The%20Proposed%20Luxury%20Hotel)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=build%20a%20Trump%20luxury%20hotel,Trump%20accepted)).

- **September 1987 – Policy Ads Echo Kremlin Talking Points:** Shortly after his Moscow trip, Trump takes out full-page newspaper ads urging the U.S. to stop spending on allies’ defense – specifically questioning the costs of protecting Japan and the oil-rich Gulf states ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=Washington%20Post%20%E2%80%93%20to%20publish,in%20Trump%20Foreign%20Policy%20Positions)). This public stance against U.S. defense commitments **mirrors the Soviet goal** of undermining Western alliances ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=He%20specifically%20questioned%20the%20expense,and%20its%20NATO%20partners)). (At the height of the Cold War, Moscow was keen to see NATO weakened and division between the U.S. and its allies ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=of%20America%27s%20allies%20not%20paying,and%20its%20NATO%20partners)).)

- **Late 1980s – KGB Interest and Further Cultivation:** Internal KGB directives in 1984–85 had called for targeting prominent Western businessmen with traits like “narcissism and corruption” ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=By%20the%20time%20Trump%20showed,Committee%20to%20Investigate%20Russia)). Trump fit the profile and the Soviets’ efforts intensified after his 1987 trip. In 1988, Trump was considering a political run, and by 1989 StB files noted he “wanted to be president in future” ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=The%20StB%20files%20%E2%80%93%20stamped,Committee%20to%20Investigate%20Russia)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=Because%20the%20StB%20often%20shared,Committee%20to%20Investigate%20Russia)). Soviet intelligence likely approved continued outreach: the 1987 Moscow venture didn’t result in a deal, but it established relationships. Trump’s public rhetoric also took on a pro-Moscow tinge – he began arguing that the U.S. and USSR should find common ground, a notable stance during the Cold War.

<details><summary><strong>1990s: Financial Troubles and Russian Dealings</strong></summary>

- **1990–1991 – Near Bankruptcy vs. Soviet Collapse:** Trump’s business empire verged on collapse around 1990. Overextended by rapid 1980s expansion, he amassed ~$4 billion in debt (with $800 million personally guaranteed) and by early 1990 was **out of cash** ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%27s%20financial%20empire%20nearly,Reuters)). Major banks bailed him out via debt restructuring to avoid his personal bankruptcy ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=Lenders%20discovered%20he%20was%20virtually,led%20bailout%20to%20survive)). At the same time, the Soviet Union’s economy was disintegrating – between 1989 and 1991, Soviet GDP plunged ~20% and by 1991 the USSR was effectively bankrupt ([DJT/Tmanch_CH2.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH2.md#:~:text=essentially%20a%20bank,survive)). Both Trump and the Kremlin entered the 1990s financially battered, setting the stage for new alliances: Trump needed cash and Russia was about to spawn a class of wealthy oligarchs seeking to move money West.

- **Early 1990s – Vulnerability and Opportunity:** In the wake of his 1990 financial crisis, Trump’s credibility with U.S. banks was shattered. He faced multiple business bankruptcies and was forced to surrender or sell assets. This vulnerability did not go unnoticed. **Foreign intelligence services** reportedly saw Trump’s desperation as an opening ([DJT/Tmanch_CH3.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH3.md#:~:text=As%20Trump%20struggled%20to%20recover,role%20in%20keeping%20his%20empire)). By the mid-1990s, there were “substantial indications” that **Russian money** started propping up Trump’s ventures during his recovery ([DJT/Tmanch_CH3.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH3.md#:~:text=Russian%20Money%20and%20Organized%20Crime,in%20Trump%27s%20Recovery)). In other words, as Trump rebuilt, cash from the former Soviet Union quietly became a lifeline when traditional financing was unavailable.

- **1996 – Reopening Moscow Ambitions:** With his finances somewhat stabilized, Trump renewed his push for a Moscow project. In 1996 he traveled to Russia with a proposal to develop a luxury residential complex ([DJT/Tmanch_CH3.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH3.md#:~:text=In%201996%2C%20as%20Trump%20was,Wikipedia)). He teamed up with two American business partners and met Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, who showed Trump plans for a new underground mall near the Kremlin ([DJT/Tmanch_CH3.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH3.md#:~:text=During%20this%20trip%2C%20Trump%20publicly,Wikipedia)). Trump gushed about Moscow’s potential, saying he’d “never been as impressed” with a city’s prospects ([DJT/Tmanch_CH3.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH3.md#:~:text=During%20this%20trip%2C%20Trump%20publicly,Wikipedia)). Despite the enthusiasm (and discussions with high-level Russian contacts), this project fizzled out, likely due to Russia’s chaotic 1990s economy and Trump’s still-limited capital ([DJT/Tmanch_CH3.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH3.md#:~:text=Wikipedia%20en,Wikipedia)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH3.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH3.md#:~:text=Despite%20the%20fanfare%2C%20the%201996,financial%20resources%20following%20his%20bankruptcies)). Notably, a Senate review found that during the 1996 trip Trump was provided an “escort” – a young American businessman tasked with accompanying him – raising suspicions that **kompromat** (compromising material) might have been collected during some “lavish” Moscow nights ([DJT/Tmanch_CH3.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH3.md#:~:text=The%20U,gathered%20during%20Trump%27s%201996%20stay)).

- **1997 – Laying Groundwork in Russia:** Anticipating future business, Trump began **registering trademarks** in Russia around 1996–97. By 1997 he had filed to secure rights to the “Trump” brand (e.g. “Trump Tower”) in Russia ([DJT/Tmanch_CH3.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH3.md#:~:text=Trademark%20Registrations%20and%20Political%20Connections)). This legal groundwork signaled that Trump was positioning himself for eventual deals in the country, even though major projects had yet to materialize.

- **1997 – Courting Russian Political Figures:** That same year, Trump hosted retired Russian General **Alexander Lebed** (a prominent politician and potential Yeltsin successor) at Trump Tower in New York ([DJT/Tmanch_CH3.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH3.md#:~:text=others%2C%20anticipating%20future%20business%20,Trump%27s%20Involvements%20With%20Russia)). Inviting Lebed – who was touring the U.S. – showed Trump’s eagerness to cultivate ties with influential Russians ([DJT/Tmanch_CH3.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH3.md#:~:text=others%2C%20anticipating%20future%20business%20,Trump%27s%20Involvements%20With%20Russia)). The meeting, well-publicized at the time, indicated Trump’s interest in Russian affairs beyond just real estate.

- **Late 1990s – Russian Cash Fuels a Comeback:** As Trump opened new properties, buyers from Russia and post-Soviet states poured in. The most dramatic example was **Trump World Tower** (a 90-story condo tower by the UN in NYC) completed in 2001. Sales in 1999–2000 were *heavily* dominated by Russian and former Soviet buyers – property records showed at least **65 units** in Trump World Tower went to Russian individuals ([DJT/Tmanch_CH3.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH3.md#:~:text=When%20Trump%20World%20Tower%20opened,The%20Moscow%20Project)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH3.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH3.md#:~:text=Prominent%20real%20estate%20broker%20Dolly,12news.com)). A real estate broker later confirmed she personally sold dozens of those condos to Russian investors ([DJT/Tmanch_CH3.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH3.md#:~:text=Prominent%20real%20estate%20broker%20Dolly,12news.com)). This influx of foreign money (many millions of dollars) was critical for Trump, who was still shunned by most U.S. banks ([DJT/Tmanch_CH3.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH3.md#:~:text=Financing%20was%20arranged%20through%20two,The%20Moscow%20Project)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH3.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH3.md#:~:text=%5B%E2%80%A6%5D%20to%20Russian%20buyers,12news.com)). By the turn of the century, **one-third of the tower’s highest-price condos were owned by people from the former USSR** ([DJT/Tmanch_CH3.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH3.md#:~:text=to%20property%20records%20and%20brokers,The%20Moscow%20Project)). In short, Russian capital helped rescue Trump’s real estate empire in the late ’90s when he badly needed buyers.

- **Late 1990s – Deutsche Bank Steps In:** With U.S. banks largely refusing Trump’s business, **Deutsche Bank** (a German bank) became his primary lender in the late 1990s. In 1998, for example, Deutsche Bank agreed to loan $125 million for Trump’s Atlantic City casino despite his past defaults ([DJT/Tmanch_CH3.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH3.md#:~:text=Financing%20was%20arranged%20through%20two,The%20Moscow%20Project)). In 1999, Deutsche Bank and another European bank provided a $640 million construction loan for Trump’s Chicago tower ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=By%20the%20early%202000s%2C%20after,Reuters)). Years later Deutsche Bank was penalized $630 million for facilitating a massive Russian money-laundering scheme – highlighting how **the bank financing Trump’s resurgence was itself entangled with Russian funds** ([DJT/Tmanch_CH3.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH3.md#:~:text=Financing%20was%20arranged%20through%20two,The%20Moscow%20Project)). This was seen as more than coincidence by investigators examining Trump’s finances.

- **2003 – Partnership with Soviet-Era Financiers:** Trump’s business model shifted in 2003 when he was introduced to **Bayrock Group**, a development firm founded by Tevfik Arif ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=In%202003%2C%20Trump%27s%20business%20trajectory,Committee%20to%20Investigate)). Arif, a Kazakh-born former Soviet official, set up Bayrock’s offices two floors below Trump’s own in Trump Tower ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=In%202003%2C%20Trump%27s%20business%20trajectory,Committee%20to%20Investigate)). He hired Felix Sater – a Russian-born businessman with organized crime ties – as Bayrock’s managing director ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Arif%20had%20hired%20Felix%20Sater,Committee%20to%20Investigate)). In 2003, Sater and Arif **pitched Trump** on partnering: Trump would license his name and provide cachet, while Bayrock brought in financing from networks in the former USSR ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=million%20stock%20fraud%20scheme%20linked,Committee%20to%20Investigate%20Russia)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Trump%2C%20impressed%20by%20Arif%27s%20international,minimal%20personal%20capital%20at%20risk)). Trump agreed, forming an alliance that became a pipeline of projects funded by post-Soviet money. *This gave Trump a way to expand his brand with minimal personal investment, leveraging Bayrock’s access to capital from Russia and Central Asia.* ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Trump%2C%20impressed%20by%20Arif%27s%20international,minimal%20personal%20capital%20at%20risk))

- **Early 2000s – Continued Russian Buyer Boom:** The trend of wealthy Russians buying Trump properties only grew. By the early 2000s, brokers joked that **targeting Russian billionaires was essential** to selling Trump condos ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Even%20before%20the%20Bayrock%20partnership,The%20Moscow%20Project)). For instance, Roman Abramovich’s wife Dasha Zhukova bought a unit in Trump World Tower around 2003 ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Moscow%20Project%20themoscowproject)). This steady flow of oligarch wealth gave Trump liquidity as he rebuilt his empire ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Even%20before%20the%20Bayrock%20partnership,The%20Moscow%20Project)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Among%20these%20purchasers%20was%20Roman,he%20rebuilt%20his%20business%20empire)), effectively making Russian investors a core constituency of Trump’s real estate business in the 2000s.

- **2005 – Attempted Moscow Deal (via Bayrock):** Eager to finally build in Moscow, Trump signed a one-year deal with Bayrock in 2005 to scout a Moscow site for a “Trump Tower Moscow” ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=During%20this%20early%20period%2C%20Trump,establish%20a%20presence%20in%20Russia)). Felix Sater traveled to Moscow and identified a potential location, even planning branding details like an “Ivanka Trump Spa” ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=During%20this%20early%20period%2C%20Trump,establish%20a%20presence%20in%20Russia)). **Trump’s daughter Ivanka and son Don Jr. visited Moscow repeatedly in 2006** pursuing this and related opportunities ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Trump%27s%20children%20also%20began%20playing,Business%20Insider)). (During one 2006 trip, Sater bragged he got Ivanka a private tour of Putin’s office chair in the Kremlin ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Trump%27s%20children%20also%20began%20playing,Business%20Insider)).) Ultimately, this 2005–06 effort did not result in a building ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Group%20to%20locate%20a%20Moscow,establish%20a%20presence%20in%20Russia)). Nonetheless, it marked Trump’s renewed push into Russia – concurrently as he **courted Russian buyers in the U.S., he was also actively seeking a flagship project on Russian soil** ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=tour%20of%20the%20Kremlin%20for,Business%20Insider)).

- **2006 – Trump SoHo and Bayrock Projects:** The partnership with Bayrock yielded several developments. In 2006, Trump announced **Trump SoHo**, a 46-story condo-hotel in Manhattan, with Bayrock and the Sapir Organization (headed by Soviet-born Tamir Sapir) as the developers ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=1,The%20Moscow%20Project)). Trump received an 18% equity stake for lending his name and expertise ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=1,The%20Moscow%20Project)). Trump SoHo embodied the formula: ex-Soviet money (Bayrock/Sapir financing) + Trump brand. Other joint projects included Trump-branded towers in Fort Lauderdale and Phoenix (which ultimately failed or stalled by 2010) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=The%20Moscow%20Project%20themoscowproject)). Bayrock also continued pitching Trump on a Moscow venture separate from the 2005 effort ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=foreclosure%20,Bayrock%20was%20a%20developer%20partner)). **Felix Sater remained a key go-between**. (Later, as Bayrock’s legal troubles mounted, Trump would downplay knowing Sater despite ample evidence of their meetings ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=relationship%20with%20Sater%2C%20famously%20saying%2C,Business%20Insider)).)

- **July 2008 – Oligarch’s Mansion Purchase:** As the U.S. financial crisis hit in 2008, Trump lucked into one of his most lucrative deals – and it involved a Russian oligarch. That month, **Dmitry Rybolovlev** (a Russian fertilizer billionaire) paid Trump **$95 million** for a Palm Beach mansion ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=The%202008%20global%20financial%20crisis,real)). Trump had bought the property four years prior for less than $41 million, meaning he flipped it for well over double the price in a collapsing real estate market ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=transactions%20involving%20a%20Russian%20buyer,Russian%20Money%20Helped%20Save%20Trump%27s)). The staggering profit (tens of millions of dollars) raised eyebrows: Senator Ron Wyden later asked U.S. Treasury to review the sale for **money-laundering red flags** ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=The%20timing%20and%20magnitude%20of,Trump%27s%20Business%20%E2%80%93%20Foreign%20Policy)). Special Counsel Mueller’s team also scrutinized the transaction ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=The%20timing%20and%20magnitude%20of,Trump%27s%20Business%20%E2%80%93%20Foreign%20Policy)). Trump insisted he simply did good business, noting “I sold it for $100 million to a Russian” ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Trump%20defended%20the%20sale%2C%20noting,the%20purchase%20may%20have%20been)). However, Rybolovlev never moved in and tore the mansion down, fueling speculation that the purchase was less about the house and more about **moving large sums of money offshore** ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Trump%20defended%20the%20sale%2C%20noting,Trump%27s%20Business%20%E2%80%93%20Foreign%20Policy)). (Notably, in 2018 the U.S. named Rybolovlev as an oligarch closely aligned with Putin ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=subdivided%20the%20property%2C%20fueling%20speculation,Trump%27s%20Business%20%E2%80%93%20Foreign%20Policy)).)

- **2008–2009 – Financial Crisis: Russian Safety Net:** During the late-2000s crash, Trump’s U.S. projects struggled (e.g. he defaulted on a big Deutsche Bank loan in 2008) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=By%20the%20early%202000s%2C%20after,Reuters)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=When%20the%202008%20financial%20crisis,Bank%20countersued%2C%20noting%20Trump%20still)). Yet even as domestic lending dried up, **Russian and post-Soviet funds continued to find their way into Trump ventures**. A Reuters analysis later found that at least 63 Russian buyers had invested around $98 million in Trump-branded properties in south Florida alone by 2008 ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=By%20the%20early%202000s%2C%20after,Russian%20Money%20Helped%20Save%20Trump%27s)). Trump’s son Don Jr. in 2008 remarked, *“Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets… we see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.”* This pattern – **Trump surviving hard times largely thanks to infusions of Russian-linked capital** – was a recurring theme by the end of the 2000s.

- **2013 – Miss Universe in Moscow:** Trump’s most significant business foray of the 2010s was hosting the **Miss Universe pageant in Moscow**. In June 2013, he struck a deal with Aras Agalarov – a billionaire developer close to the Kremlin – to bring the Miss Universe competition to Moscow that November ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=The%20Agalarov%20Relationship)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=In%20June%202013%2C%20Trump%20dined,Linked%20Transactions%20From%20the)).

On November 9, 2013, the pageant was held at Agalarov’s Crocus City Hall, attended by a who’s-who of Russia’s elite ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=The%20Miss%20Universe%20pageant%20took,desired%20Moscow%20real%20estate%20project)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=During%20his%20visit%20to%20Moscow%2C,WNYC%20Studios)). Trump used the event to network extensively: *“almost all of the oligarchs were in the room,”* he boasted ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=During%20his%20visit%20to%20Moscow%2C,WNYC%20Studios)). Among the VIPs was Herman Gref, CEO of Russia’s largest state bank (Sberbank) and a key Putin ally ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=During%20his%20visit%20to%20Moscow%2C,WNYC%20Studios)).

- **2013 – Pursuit of Trump Tower Moscow (Agalarov Project):** The pageant doubled as a springboard for Trump’s longtime dream of building in Moscow. During the visit, **Trump discussed plans for a Trump Tower Moscow** with the Agalarovs ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=The%20Trump%20Tower%20Moscow%20Discussions)). He even tweeted excitedly while departing Russia: *“TRUMP TOWER-MOSCOW is next.”* ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Throughout%20his%20Moscow%20visit%2C%20Trump,Wikipedia)). Agalarov’s company and Trump’s team exchanged proposals into 2014. They scouted sites and considered financing – at one point, a plan to gift Vladimir Putin a $50 million penthouse in the proposed tower was floated as an incentive (this detail emerged later during investigations). However, the project stalled and by the end of 2014 Donald Trump Jr. admitted it had “died of deal fatigue” ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=The%20proposed%20Trump%20Tower%20Moscow,WNYC%20Studios)). One major factor was geopolitics: in early 2014, Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine (Crimea) led to U.S. sanctions, likely dampening the enthusiasm on both sides ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=The%20proposed%20Trump%20Tower%20Moscow,WNYC%20Studios)).

- **2013–2014 – Putin Outreach and Praise:** In the lead-up to and aftermath of the Miss Universe event, Trump made unusually direct public overtures to Vladimir Putin. Before the pageant, he tweeted asking if Putin would attend and “become my new best friend” ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Trump%27s%20public%20overtures%20to%20Vladimir,POLITICO)). Putin did not attend, but reportedly sent Trump a friendly gift and note ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=Trump%27s%20public%20overtures%20to%20Vladimir,POLITICO)). After the event, Trump continued to praise Putin. In early 2014, as tensions rose over Ukraine, Trump lauded Putin’s leadership and claimed Putin had “outsmarted” the Obama administration ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=After%20the%20Miss%20Universe%20pageant%2C,Business%20Insider)). At CPAC in March 2014, he called Putin “a strong guy” while deriding President Obama as weak ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=After%20the%20Miss%20Universe%20pageant%2C,Business%20Insider)). Trump consistently argued that the U.S. would be better off **getting along with Russia**, a stance he hammered even as Putin seized Crimea. These comments stood out at the time, given that most American figures were condemning Putin’s aggression.

- **2014 – Continued Financial Ties:** Despite the collapse of the Agalarov tower plan, Trump’s business ties to Russia remained alive. He had spent years carefully cultivating relationships and trademarks in Russia (as noted in the 1996–97 entries). By 2014, Trump had a “complex network” of connections to Russian business interests ([DJT/Tmanch_CH4.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH4.md#:~:text=2013%20Miss%20Universe%20pageant%20in,intense%20scrutiny%20by%20intelligence%20agencies)). This foundation would soon prove useful as he transitioned to an unexpected new arena: presidential politics.

- **2015 – Preparing a Presidential Run:** In 2015, Trump turned his focus to a White House bid. Notably, **his friendly posture toward Russia did not change** as he entered politics – if anything, his private dealings with Russia intensified (even as the U.S. public was largely unaware). Trump announced his candidacy in June 2015. By that point, he had spent decades interacting with Russian money and figures, leaving a trail of potential foreign leverage points as he sought the nation’s highest office.

- **Oct 2015 – Secret Moscow Tower Deal During Campaign:** While running for president, Trump **secretly pursued a Trump Tower Moscow** development.

- **2015–2016 – Public Denials vs. Private Pursuits:** On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly claimed **“I have no dealings with Russia”** and “zero investments” there ([DJT/DJT 2015-2021.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/DJT%202015-2021.md#:~:text=Public%20Denials%20vs,2018%2C%20Cohen%20pleaded%20guilty%20to)). In reality, his company was actively courting the Kremlin for a massive profit opportunity even as Russians were working to influence the U.S. election. This disparity became a focus for investigators: later, in 2018, Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to **lying to Congress** about the timeline of the Moscow deal, admitting he did so to align with Trump’s false public narrative ([DJT/DJT 2015-2021.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/DJT%202015-2021.md#:~:text=divergence%20between%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20public%20statements,Trump%20signed%20off%20on%20Moscow)). In short, during the campaign Trump had a hidden financial incentive to please the Kremlin (a potential real estate windfall), which raised conflict-of-interest red flags ([DJT/DJT 2015-2021.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/DJT%202015-2021.md#:~:text=campaign%20,Trump%E2%80%99s)).

- **April 2016 – Adviser Learns of Hacked “Dirt”:** Low-level campaign adviser **George Papadopoulos** was told by contacts linked to Moscow that the Russians had “thousands of emails” with dirt on Hillary Clinton ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=2,Advisers)). This was months before the Clinton-related emails became public. Papadopoulos informed Trump’s campaign superiors. When the FBI later interviewed him, he lied to conceal his Russian contacts (and eventually pled guilty for that false statement) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Just)). This episode showed the Trump campaign **was tipped off early** about Russia’s hacking efforts.

- **June 9, 2016 – Trump Tower Meeting:** In one of the campaign’s most infamous moments, Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort met at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer **promising incriminating information on Clinton** as “part of Russia and its government’s support” for Trump ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,to%20receive%20foreign%20electoral%20help)).

The attendees included Kremlin-linked lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and broker Rob Goldstone. The meeting did not yield the promised dirt (discussion shifted to sanctions), but it demonstrated the **Trump team’s willingness to accept foreign election help** ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,to%20receive%20foreign%20electoral%20help)). When news of this meeting emerged later, it became a focal point in investigations.

- **Summer 2016 – Campaign Chairman’s Russian Backchannel:** **Paul Manafort**, Trump’s campaign chairman (from May to August 2016), had extensive Russian connections. He’d worked for pro-Kremlin Ukrainian politicians and owed millions to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=Paul%20Manafort%E2%80%99s%20role%20was%20pivotal%3A)). During the campaign, Manafort covertly shared **internal polling data and strategy** with Konstantin Kilimnik – a longtime colleague identified by the FBI as a Russian intelligence officer ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Roll%20Call)). This confidential campaign information, handed directly to a suspected Russian agent, led the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee to deem Manafort’s actions a “grave counterintelligence threat” ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=politics.%20,Roll%20Call)). U.S. officials feared the data could have helped Russia target its influence operations in 2016. (Manafort resigned in August 2016 after his Ukraine ties became public, but evidence shows he remained in contact with Trump and Kilimnik thereafter.)

- **July 2016 – Carter Page’s Moscow Trip:** Adviser **Carter Page** traveled to Moscow in July 2016, ostensibly as a private citizen, where he met with Russian officials and businessmen ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=Lied%20to%20the%20FBI%20about,Just%20Security)). U.S. intelligence had been aware that Russian spies previously tried to recruit Page in 2013–14 ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=%28Politico%29%20www.politico.eu%20%20,Just%20Security)). His high-level Moscow contacts during the campaign (and subsequent boasts in Russia that Trump would be good for relations) led the FBI to obtain a surveillance warrant on Page. This later became controversial, but at the time it indicated the FBI’s **concern that Russian intelligence was actively interfacing with Trump advisers**.

- **June–Nov 2016 – Russian “Active Measures” to Elect Trump:** Russian interference in the election ramped up dramatically in mid-2016:
  - **Cyber Attacks:** Beginning in March 2016, hackers from Russia’s GRU (military intelligence) penetrated Democratic Party servers. They stole tens of thousands of emails from the DNC and Clinton campaign chair John Podesta ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=2,Leaks%2C%20Propaganda)). The stolen emails were **strategically leaked via WikiLeaks** in July and October 2016 to damage Clinton ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=2,Leaks%2C%20Propaganda)).
  - **Trump’s Public Invitation:** On July 27, 2016, Trump famously said *“Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you can find the 30,000 [Clinton] emails that are missing.”* ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Propaganda%3A%20Russian%20troll%20farm%20orchestrated)) Within hours, Russian hackers for the first time targeted Clinton’s personal office servers ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,voters%20and%20assist%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20candidacy)), suggesting they acted on Trump’s remarks.
  - **Social Media Propaganda:** Meanwhile, the Kremlin-backed **Internet Research Agency (IRA)** ran a massive online influence campaign ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,voters%20and%20assist%20Trump%E2%80%99s)). Troll accounts posing as Americans flooded Facebook, Twitter, etc., with divisive content favoring Trump or discouraging pro-Clinton voter turnout.
  
  U.S. intelligence would later conclude that these Russian “active measures” aimed explicitly to help Trump win. Trump and his campaign often **amplified or welcomed the hack-and-leak news** on the trail. While no evidence emerged that the campaign illegally conspired in advance, the Mueller investigation documented that the campaign *“expected it would benefit electorally”* from Russia’s actions and **made use of them** (for example, repeatedly touting the WikiLeaks releases) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=4)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,refuting%20claims%20of%20a%20hoax)).

- **Nov 8, 2016 – Election Day:** Donald Trump is elected President of the United States. Russian officials and state media celebrated the outcome, having arguably achieved Moscow’s objective of sowing disruption and electing a less hostile U.S. leader. During the transition that followed, Trump continued to downplay Russia’s role, even as outgoing President Obama imposed sanctions and expulsions in response to the interference.

</details>

<details><summary><strong>2016–2017 Transition: Backchannels and Sanctions</strong></summary>

- **Nov–Dec 2016 – Private Outreach to Russia:** Immediately after the election, Trump’s team engaged in unusual secret contacts with Russian officials. Jared **Kushner (Trump’s son-in-law)** met Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in early December and discussed establishing a **private back-channel** using Russian diplomatic facilities – a highly irregular proposal seemingly meant to evade U.S. intelligence monitoring ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=3,2017)). Around the same time, Kushner met with the head of a sanctioned Russian state bank (VEB) in a meeting brokered by Kislyak. These covert communications set the tone for a **non-traditional transition**, where the incoming administration signaled warmer ties with Moscow even before taking office.

- **Dec 29, 2016 – Flynn’s Secret Sanctions Talks:** On the very day the Obama administration announced new sanctions and expulsions against Russia for election meddling, Trump’s incoming National Security Advisor **Michael Flynn** called Russian Ambassador Kislyak ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=3,Sanctions)). In multiple calls, Flynn **urged Moscow not to retaliate** for the U.S. sanctions ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=3,Sanctions)) – implying that the new Trump administration would reverse course. Indeed, Russia unusually *did not retaliate* to those December sanctions, a decision President Putin said was based on the “incoming administration” (Trump tweeted praise of Putin’s response). Flynn’s calls were **secretly recorded by U.S. intelligence** (as Kislyak was monitored). When this came to light, Flynn initially lied to administration officials (and the FBI) about discussing sanctions ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,him%20vulnerable%20to%20Russian%20leverage)).

- **Jan 2017 – Warnings and Resignation:** In late January, acting Attorney General Sally Yates informed the White House that Flynn had lied about his Kislyak contacts and was vulnerable to Russian blackmail (since Moscow knew the truth) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,him%20vulnerable%20to%20Russian%20leverage)). The White House counsel was told Flynn’s deception was serious. Only after these warnings became public did Trump fire Flynn on Feb 13, 2017 – just 24 days into the term – officially for misleading the Vice President ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=Flynn%E2%80%99s%20resignation%20soon%20followed,secrecy%20surrounding%20the%20transition)). Flynn later pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his Russian communications. His short tenure and the circumstances of his removal marked the first big scandal of the new administration, centered squarely on improper Russian ties.

- **Jan 2017 – Intelligence Briefings on Russian Meddling:** During the transition, U.S. intelligence agencies delivered a report to Trump (on Jan 6, 2017) concluding that **Russia’s Putin had ordered an influence campaign to help Trump’s election**. President-elect Trump publicly dismissed these findings, comparing the intelligence community to Nazis for leaking information and insisting the idea of Russian interference was a “political witch hunt.” This set up a conflict between Trump and his own intelligence agencies that would persist through his presidency, as he often sided with Russia’s denials over U.S. assessments.

</details>

<details><summary><strong>2017–2021: Trump Presidency – Policy Shifts, Investigations, and Impeachment</strong></summary>

- **Jan 20, 2017 – Inauguration and Policy Shift:** In his inaugural address, Trump struck a nationalist tone (“America First”), which dovetailed with Russian narratives about reducing U.S. global involvement. Once in office, Trump moved quickly to differentiate his Russia policy from his predecessor’s. **Early in 2017, Trump officials explored unilaterally lifting or easing sanctions on Russia** imposed for Ukraine and election interference ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=4,Objectives)). (These efforts were largely thwarted by career officials and Congress, which passed new sanctions with veto-proof majorities in summer 2017.) Nevertheless, the intent signaled a sharp break from prior U.S. policy.

- **May 2017 – Comey Fired, Special Counsel Appointed:** On May 9, 2017, Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, who was overseeing the FBI’s Russia investigation. Trump told Russian officials the next day that firing Comey relieved “great pressure” related to Russia. In response, Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein appointed **Robert Mueller as Special Counsel** to continue the Russia inquiry. Mueller’s investigation (2017–2019) became one of the most extensive in modern history:
  - It ultimately **documented “sweeping and systematic” Russian election interference** and over 100 contacts between Trump’s associates and Russian-linked individuals ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=4)). 
  - While Mueller did not charge any Trump associate with a conspiracy, several were convicted of crimes **stemming from the probe** – including Michael Flynn, George Papadopoulos, Paul Manafort, Michael Cohen, and Roger Stone ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=4)). Notably, many of these convictions were for lying about their Russian contacts, indicating an effort to conceal the campaign’s myriad links.
  - The Mueller Report (delivered March 2019) stopped short of accusing Trump of a crime but pointedly did not exonerate him on obstruction of justice. It also laid out how the campaign **welcomed and benefited from Russia’s actions** even if no criminal coordination was proven ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=4)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=While%20no%20criminal%20conspiracy%20was,campaign%E2%80%99s%20openness%20to%20these%20efforts)).

- **2017–2018 – Foreign Policy Departures Benefiting Russia:** As President, Trump often took positions that puzzled U.S. allies and thrilled Moscow:
  - **NATO Undermined:** Trump repeatedly criticized NATO, calling it “obsolete” and pressuring allies to pay more. It later emerged that in 2018 and again in 2019, Trump privately discussed **pulling the U.S. out of NATO altogether** ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=complete%20U.S.%20withdrawal.2%20,Atlantic%20Council)). Such a move would be a dream come true for the Kremlin, effectively dismantling the Western alliance. (Trump never withdrew, but his rhetoric alone raised doubts about U.S. commitment to NATO.)
  - **Allies and G7:** Trump antagonized traditional allies (Germany’s Angela Merkel, etc.) while suggesting Russia be re-admitted to the G7 (from which it was ousted after invading Ukraine in 2014). At one G7 summit he refused to sign a joint statement and argued for Russia’s return, leaving U.S. partners alarmed.
  - **Syria and Middle East:** In 2017, Trump ordered a limited strike on Syria’s Assad (a Russian ally) after chemical attacks, but in 2019 he abruptly announced a pullout of U.S. forces in Syria. That withdrawal benefited Russia by expanding the Kremlin’s influence in the region and abandoning U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters.
  - **Helsinki Summit (July 2018):** In a joint press conference with Vladimir Putin, Trump publicly sided with Putin’s denial of election interference over the unanimous conclusions of U.S. intelligence. He said “President Putin says it’s not Russia... I don’t see any reason why it *would* be” Russia. This astonishing statement drew bipartisan condemnation back home. (Trump later attempted to walk it back.) The incident cemented perceptions that Trump was **unusually deferential to Putin**, even on the world stage.

- **2019 – “No Collusion” and Continued Concessions:** After Mueller concluded without charging a criminal conspiracy, Trump claimed total vindication (“No collusion!”). In reality, Mueller had exposed significant misconduct and counterintelligence risks ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=4)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,refuting%20claims%20of%20a%20hoax)). But emboldened, Trump continued to make contrarian moves:
  - He **downplayed Russia’s interference** as a “hoax” or a “witch hunt” concocted by Democrats, despite U.S. intelligence and Mueller’s findings. 
  - He delayed or opposed new penalties on Russia. For example, in 2019, Congress mandated sanctions on Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline; the Trump administration slow-rolled the implementation.
  - He abruptly held up military aid to Ukraine (see below) and advocated readmitting Russia to international groups. In meetings, Trump often spoke sympathetically of Russia’s point of view (questioning why the U.S. opposed Russian actions in Ukraine or elsewhere).

- **July 25, 2019 – Call with Ukraine and Impeachment:** In a phone call on July 25, President Trump asked Ukraine’s President Zelensky for a “favor” – to investigate Joe Biden – and mentioned U.S. aid and support in the context of that request. It later emerged that Trump had **ordered a hold on nearly $400 million in congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine**, which was battling Russian-led forces, just days before the call ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,of%20personal%20or%20unexplained%20motives)). In essence, Trump was using critical aid as leverage to solicit domestic political help. This directly harmed Ukraine’s defense (serving Russia’s interests) and bypassed official policy for personal gain ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,of%20personal%20or%20unexplained%20motives)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=personal%20political%20favors%20related%20to,in%20favor%20of%20personal%20or)). When a whistleblower revealed the scheme, the House launched an impeachment inquiry in fall 2019. Trump was impeached on Dec 18, 2019, for Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Congress – the core of the abuse being **conditioning aid to an ally at war with Russia on a personal favor** ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,of%20personal%20or%20unexplained%20motives)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=personal%20political%20favors%20related%20to,of%20personal%20or%20unexplained%20motives)). In the Senate trial (Jan–Feb 2020), Trump was acquitted along party lines. However, evidence showed the freeze on Ukraine aid was only released after Congress and media uncovered it, highlighting how Trump’s actions aligned with Putin’s agenda (undermining Ukraine) even if driven by Trump’s own political motives.

- **August 2020 – Senate Bipartisan Report:** The Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee published its final report on Russian election interference (Volume 5) in August 2020. It went even further than Mueller in some respects:
  - The report detailed extensive links between Trump associates and Russians and stated the campaign’s interactions **constituted a “grave counterintelligence threat.”** ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=4,Reports))
  - It affirmed that the Kremlin directed a covert operation to help Trump in 2016, **validating the intelligence community’s conclusions** and explicitly refuting Trump’s claims that the Russia story was a hoax ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,refuting%20claims%20of%20a%20hoax)).
  - Notably, it described Manafort’s sharing of internal data with Kilimnik as a clear danger and found evidence suggestive (though not proving) that Kilimnik may have been involved in the Russian hack-and-leak operation. In essence, a bipartisan investigation confirmed that Russia had influenced the election on Trump’s behalf and that Trump’s team **knowingly created openings for that influence**.

- **2020 Election – Continued Interference:** As the 2020 election approached, U.S. intelligence warned that Russia was at it again – interfering in the election to support Trump (and denigrate Biden). In 2020, the Trump administration’s intelligence officials assessed that pro-Russian actors were spreading misleading narratives about Biden (including through people close to Trump). Even after leaving office, additional evidence (declassified in 2021) showed **persistent Russian efforts to bolster Trump’s candidacies in both 2016 and 2020** ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=Following%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20departure%20from%20the,White%20House)). Trump, however, persistently denied or minimized these findings.

</details>

<details><summary><strong>2021–2023: Post-Presidency and Ongoing Foreign Influence Concerns</strong></summary>

- **January 2021 – Deutsche Bank Ends Relationship:** Following the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot and Trump’s turbulent exit from office, Deutsche Bank – the one major bank that had lent to Trump for decades – **cut ties with Trump** and his businesses ([DJT/Tmanch_CH6.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH6.md#:~:text=1,Financing%20Shifts)). This severed a critical source of financing. Deutsche Bank’s exit came after years of scrutiny over its dealings with Trump and laundering scandals involving Russian money. The break left Trump seeking new lenders just as several huge loans were coming due.

- **2021–2022 – Financial Investigations:** Out of office, Trump faced intensified investigations into his finances. In 2021–22, congressional committees (led by House Democrats) subpoenaed records on Trump’s foreign business ties, citing **counterintelligence risks** in his opaque finances ([DJT/Tmanch_CH6.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH6.md#:~:text=3,Foreign%20Financial%20Ties)). They particularly targeted his Deutsche Bank records to uncover any undisclosed Russian or other foreign leverage ([DJT/Tmanch_CH6.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH6.md#:~:text=3,Foreign%20Financial%20Ties)). These inquiries, along with ongoing criminal probes in New York, sought to answer lingering questions raised in the case study: Did Trump’s business debt or deals compromise his independence? (By 2022 the courts cleared the way for Congress to obtain some of Trump’s financial records, but findings have not been fully public.)

- **Feb 2022 – Praising Putin as War Breaks Out:** In February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Instead of condemning the aggression, Trump initially **praised Vladimir Putin’s strategy**. He called Putin “savvy” and “genius” for the way he had recognized breakaway Ukrainian regions and moved troops in ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,7)). These remarks came even as the U.S. and its allies were uniting to support Ukraine. Trump’s stance once again dovetailed with Russian messaging, which portrayed Putin as shrewd and the West as weak. The comments sparked a bipartisan backlash in the U.S., but Trump doubled down, later claiming if he were still president, Putin wouldn’t have invaded (while also complimenting Putin’s boldness). His pro-Kremlin rhetoric during the Ukraine crisis renewed debates about **Trump consistently echoing Russian narratives** ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,7)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,7)).

- **2022 – Mysterious $8 Million to Trump Media:** In late 2021 and 2022, Trump launched a new social media venture (Truth Social under the Trump Media & Technology Group). It soon needed cash. In 2022, it was reported that **$8 million in loans poured into Trump Media from a tiny bank in Dominica** – a bank linked to the family of a close Putin ally (Aleksandr Smirnov) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH6.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH6.md#:~:text=1.3%20Russian,Media%20Venture)). The funds arrived at a critical time when other financing was faltering. This opaque infusion raised eyebrows: a foreign bank with possible **Russian connections became a lifeline to Trump’s company** ([DJT/Tmanch_CH6.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH6.md#:~:text=1.3%20Russian,Media%20Venture)). U.S. prosecutors began examining this transaction in 2023. The incident suggests that even out of office, Trump’s enterprises may have leaned on Russian-linked money when mainstream sources were unavailable.

- **2021–2023 – Continued Pro-Russia Stance:** As a private citizen, Trump consistently stuck to positions favorable to Russia:
  - He repeatedly slammed NATO, continuing to argue that allies don’t pay their “fair share” and even suggesting the U.S. might not defend NATO countries if they don’t increase spending ([DJT/Tmanch_CH6.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH6.md#:~:text=2,and%20Alignment%20with%20Russian%20Messaging)). This rhetoric – questioning the foundational principle of NATO’s collective defense – remained **unprecedented for a former President**, and in line with Putin’s goal of fracturing NATO.
  - Trump also **maintained his denial of Russian interference** in U.S. elections, insisting the entire Russia investigation was a partisan “hoax” ([DJT/Tmanch_CH6.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH6.md#:~:text=2,and%20FBI%20%E2%80%9CHoax%E2%80%9D%20Claims)). He attacked the FBI and U.S. intelligence, and even praised those (like Fox News hosts) who propagated pro-Russia narratives about the 2016 election. This refusal to acknowledge Kremlin meddling (which U.S. agencies and bipartisan reports had long since confirmed) pleased Moscow and helped sow continued doubt among Trump’s supporters about Russia’s role.
  - Throughout Russia’s war on Ukraine, Trump’s comments often undermined U.S. support for Ukraine. He criticized the Biden administration’s aid packages and said instead of helping Ukraine resist, **the U.S. should push for a deal that could concede territory** (echoing Russian talking points). He vowed he could end the war in “24 hours,” without clarifying how – leaving many to wonder if that meant pressuring Ukraine to accept Russian terms.

- **2023–2024 – Russian Interference in the 2024 Campaign:** As Trump sought a return to the White House in 2024, signs emerged that Russia was again favoring his candidacy. U.S. intelligence and law enforcement observed renewed covert influence efforts:
  - Russian state-controlled media openly **cheerleaded Trump’s 2024 run**, airing positive coverage of Trump while denigrating his likely opponent(s). This echoed the pattern from 2016 ([DJT/Tmanch_CH6.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH6.md#:~:text=4.1%20Kremlin)).
  - Behind the scenes, Russian cyber units and troll farms that targeted previous elections were detected preparing for 2024 operations ([DJT/Tmanch_CH6.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH6.md#:~:text=4.1%20Kremlin)). In late 2023, the FBI and other agencies warned that Kremlin-linked actors were attempting to infiltrate U.S. political networks and were *“trying to sow discord”* with themes similar to prior pro-Trump influence campaigns ([DJT/Tmanch_CH6.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH6.md#:~:text=4.1%20Kremlin)).
  
  By the end of 2023, the U.S. had not publicly detailed all intelligence, but it was clear Russia’s preference for Trump – as a candidate whose foreign policy might benefit Moscow – remained unchanged. Trump, for his part, indicated that if elected he might pardon many figures in the Russia probe and even **pardon Putin** (for war crimes) as some reports suggested, doubling down on his image as an unusually Russia-aligned Republican. The stage was set for a 2024 election with an unprecedented backdrop: a former U.S. president running while openly questioning NATO and praising the leader of an adversary nation, and that adversary actively working to see him victorious again.

<details><summary><strong>2025: Second Term Policy Shifts Benefiting Russia (January-March)</strong></summary>

- **January 20-21, 2025 – Inauguration and Aid Freeze:** Trump begins his second term with a declaration that the U.S. would "expand its territory," followed by an executive order **freezing all foreign aid for 90 days**, including $16.4 billion in pledged assistance to Ukraine ([EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_foreign_aid_freeze_(fictional))). This immediate policy shift cuts a lifeline to Ukraine as it defends against Russian invasion.

- **January-February 2025 – Pro-Russia Personnel Changes:** Trump installs officials with histories of downplaying Russian threats in key national security positions and purges career staff. National Security Advisor Michael Waltz sends home about 160 NSC staffers; John Ratcliffe (who previously minimized Russian election interference) becomes CIA Director; and Tulsi Gabbard (with her history of comments aligning with Russian narratives) is confirmed as Director of National Intelligence.

- **February 24, 2025 – UN Alignment with Moscow:** The U.S. joins Russia in voting "no" on a European-backed UN resolution condemning Russia's invasion and demanding Russian troop withdrawal ([TRIBUNEINDIA.COM](https://www.tribuneindia.com/)). When France amends a separate resolution to name Russia as the aggressor, the U.S. delegation abstains rather than support language criticizing Russia – shocking Western allies.

- **February 2025 – Sidelining Ukraine and NATO:** Trump authorizes direct peace talks with Russia **without Ukraine or NATO participation** ([Putin-Trump meeting is possible this month but may be later, Kremlin says | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kremlin-says-putin-trump-could-meet-before-end-february-agencies-report-2025-02-19/#:~:text=The%20talks%20in%20Riyadh%20were,Europe%20since%20World%20War%20Two)). Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov welcomes these talks as a "very important step" toward settlement – underscoring Moscow's view that Trump's approach serves Russian interests.

- **March 3, 2025 – Halt to Ukraine Military Aid:** Following a tense February 28 meeting where Trump berated Zelenskyy for being "insufficiently grateful," the White House confirms the **complete suspension of U.S. military aid to Ukraine** ([Trump halts all U.S. military aid to Ukraine, White House official says | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-halts-all-us-military-aid-ukraine-white-house-official-says-2025-03-04/#:~:text=The%20move%20comes%20after%20Trump,in%20the%20war%20with%20Russia)). This strategic gift to Putin leaves Ukraine vulnerable and European allies scrambling to fill the gap.
