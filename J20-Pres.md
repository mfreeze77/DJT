- <span style="color:red">USAID has historically countered Russian influence by funding pro-democracy and humanitarian work, so dismantling it directly helps Moscow fill that vacuum</span>

- <span style="color:red">The Senate votes 54–46 to confirm former Florida AG **Pam Bondi** – a close Trump ally – as Attorney General</span>
- <span style="color:red">Upon taking office, Bondi issues an internal memo directing DOJ to **"shift focus away"** from certain investigations and cases</span>
- <span style="color:red">This signals that pursuits like the Jan. 6 prosecutions and probes into foreign influence (e.g. Russian election interference) will be deprioritized</span>
- <span style="color:red">Bondi's memo also disbands the FBI's Foreign Influence Task Force (FITF) and deprioritizes Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) prosecutions</span>
- <span style="color:red">The FITF had been established in 2017 after Russia's election interference, to investigate and disrupt foreign influence operations</span>
- <span style="color:red">Bondi's memo also eliminated Task Force KleptoCapture, created by the Biden DOJ in March 2022 to go after wealthy Russians' illicit assets and enforce the sweeping sanctions imposed on Russia for its war</span>
- <span style="color:red">The Senate confirms **Tulsi Gabbard** as Director of National Intelligence in a 52–48 vote</span>
- <span style="color:red">Gabbard, who has been criticized for echoing Kremlin talking points in the past, now oversees all U.S. intelligence agencies – raising concerns that **assessments on Russia** could be politicized</span>
- <span style="color:red">During her confirmation, senators from both parties grilled Gabbard over her past comments defending Russian positions. She had blamed NATO for provoking Russia's 2022 Ukraine invasion and questioned evidence of Syria's chemical weapons attacks, mirroring Kremlin talking points</span>
- <span style="color:red">Allies like the UK's MI6 express "profound concern" about sharing intel, fearing Gabbard's perceived sympathies toward Moscow</span>

- <span style="color:red">Patel previously helped draft memos discrediting the FBI's Russia investigation</span>
- <span style="color:red">Patel is a former aide known for pushing the narrative that the FBI's 2016 Russia probe was a "hoax" and for helping Rep. Devin Nunes draft the controversial 2018 memo that sought to discredit the FBI and Justice Department's handling of the Russia investigation</span>
- <span style="color:red">His background is "overtly partisan" and he has "a long history of conspiracy theorizing," including efforts to "discredit" investigations into Russian election interference</span>
- <span style="color:red">Civil rights and government watchdog groups uniformly opposed Patel's nomination, with one coalition warning that his confirmation would "cripple the FBI's impartiality" in matters of political corruption and foreign influence</span>

- <span style="color:red">In a joint press conference, Trump touts progress toward a peace deal and pointedly refers to European aid to Ukraine as essentially a **"loan"** that will be repaid – contrasting it with U.S. support</span>
- <span style="color:red">That same day, the U.S. shocks allies by **voting against a U.N. resolution condemning Russia's invasion** of Ukraine, arguing that focus should shift to peace terms</span>
- <span style="color:red">The U.S. also abstains on an amendment labeling Russia the aggressor. Allies are shocked by America's reversal; Russia praises the U.S. for "understanding" its position</span>

- <span style="color:red">Trump announces he will appoint conservative media personality **Dan Bongino** as Deputy Director of the FBI</span>
- <span style="color:red">Bongino, a fervent Trump defender with little high-level law enforcement experience, is set to serve under Director Patel</span>
- <span style="color:red">The appointment further **politicizes FBI leadership** – potentially undermining investigations, including those related to Russian espionage</span>
- <span style="color:red">Both Patel and Bongino have publicly called the Russia probe a "hoax." Analysts expect U.S. vigilance toward Russian threats to diminish</span>

- <span style="color:red">The Ukrainian delegation is then asked to leave the White House</span>
- <span style="color:red">This extraordinary **public humiliation of a wartime ally** leaves Zelenskyy empty-handed – and clearly signals a U.S. pivot away from unqualified support for Ukraine</span>

- <span style="color:red">The White House portrays the pause as a move to ensure aid is "contributing to a solution" and to pressure Kyiv to **come to the negotiating table** on Washington's terms</span>
- <span style="color:red">The directive, made just days after Trump had personally castigated Zelenskyy, makes good on his implicit threat to leverage U.S. support</span>

<summary><strong>March 5, 2025 – Intelligence Sharing Cut Off</strong></summary>

- <span style="color:red">This cut-off severs Ukraine from real-time U.S. intelligence on Russian troop movements and cyber threats</span>
- <span style="color:red">A senior Ukrainian official warns this will make it **more difficult to strike Russian forces**, though Ukraine could still rely on commercial satellite imagery</span>
- <span style="color:red">This drastic step is part of Trump's pressure campaign to make Zelenskyy "serious about peace" after the Oval Office clash</span>

- <span style="color:red">Former National Security Adviser John Bolton expresses astonishment: *"These are Cabinet-level people…not one of them ever said, 'Why are we on Signal?'"*</span>

- <span style="color:red">Signal's developers respond that there is no fundamental flaw in the app's cryptography – the issue is users falling for impersonation attacks – and say they had added new safeguards and warnings "months ago" to combat such phishing tactics</span>
- <span style="color:red">Cybersecurity experts echo that the real vulnerability isn't Signal's encryption but human error: officials' poor operational security in handling the app</span>

- <span style="color:blue">On Sunday, March 23, U.S., Ukrainian, and Russian officials converge in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia for back-to-back peace discussions</span>
- <span style="color:red">Steve Witkoff strikes an upbeat tone in a Fox News interview that morning, claiming *"I feel that [Putin] wants peace"* and predicting "real progress" in the upcoming talks</span>
- <span style="color:blue">Talks begin with a U.S.-Ukraine meeting that day, followed by a direct U.S.-Russia meeting on Monday</span>
- <span style="color:blue">A key focus is implementing limited ceasefires: Witkoff speaks of a possible **Black Sea maritime truce** to protect shipping, which he suggests could naturally *"gravitate into a full-on shooting ceasefire"* over time</span>
- <span style="color:blue">He also notes Putin has agreed, at least temporarily, to stop attacking Ukraine's energy infrastructure (honoring the pause from March 18)</span>
- <span style="color:blue">Ukraine's defense minister Rustem Umerov, present in Riyadh, calls Sunday's discussions "constructive" – focusing on safeguarding the energy sector and humanitarian issues</span>
- <span style="color:blue">The U.S. side also raises "confidence-building measures," such as addressing the fate of Ukrainian children taken to Russia</span>
- <span style="color:red">The Kremlin dampens expectations, with spokesman Dmitry Peskov warning that *"difficult negotiations"* lie ahead and *"we are only at the beginning of this path"*</span>
- <span style="color:red">In fact, even as delegates meet, intense fighting continues in Ukraine: overnight March 23, Russia launches 147 drones at Ukrainian cities, killing at least seven civilians (including a child) amid ongoing carnage</span>

<summary><strong>March 24, 2025 – Signal Leak Exposed to Public</strong></summary>

- <span style="color:red">The secret White House Signal chat debacle bursts into the open when *The Atlantic* publishes a bombshell first-person account by Jeffrey Goldberg, the very journalist accidentally added to the Yemen war group</span>
- <span style="color:red">Titled "The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans," Goldberg's piece (published Monday) details how he was invited to a Signal group on March 11 by what appeared to be NSA Mike Waltz's account</span>
- <span style="color:red">By March 15, he found himself reading along as top national security officials – including the defense secretary, national security advisor, CIA director (John Ratcliffe), DNI (Tulsi Gabbard), even Vice President J.D. Vance – discussed striking the Houthis</span>
- <span style="color:red">Goldberg recounts receiving Hegseth's detailed strike plan message and his disbelief that it was real until the explosions confirmed it</span>
- <span style="color:red">The article underscores the stunning negligence of conducting military planning on a personal app</span>
- <span style="color:red">It also raises the question of whether Waltz's Signal account had been hacked or spoofed – Waltz ambiguously suggests Goldberg might have "hacked his way in," which Goldberg flatly denies</span>
- <span style="color:red">The administration scrambles to contain the fallout, with intelligence chiefs preparing to testify before Congress the next day</span>
- <span style="color:blue">The story fuels criticism that Trump's team is inexperienced and reckless, even in matters of war and peace</span>

<summary><strong>March 25, 2025 – U.S.-Russia Agree to Partial Ceasefires & Sanctions Concessions</strong></summary>

- <span style="color:blue">In a breakthrough following the Riyadh meetings, Washington announces that it has brokered **two parallel interim truces** – one with Ukraine and one with Russia – to pause certain hostilities</span>
- <span style="color:blue">The deals, revealed on March 25, call for a halt to attacks in two critical areas: the *Black Sea* and *energy infrastructure*</span>
- <span style="color:blue">Effective immediately, both Ukraine and Russia agree to cease targeting each other's ships and ports, and to stop strikes on power plants, oil/gas facilities, and the electricity grid</span>
- <span style="color:red">To secure Moscow's assent, the U.S. makes a significant offer: **Washington would push for relief from some international sanctions on Russia**, specifically those hindering Russia's agricultural and fertilizer exports</span>
- <span style="color:red">Shortly after the announcement, the Kremlin adds more strings: it declares the maritime pact wouldn't take effect unless Russian banks regained access to the global financial system (e.g. reconnecting some banks to SWIFT)</span>
- <span style="color:blue">President Zelensky, who had accepted the partial ceasefire plan, pushes back firmly – saying **no such sanctions relief was agreed** and calling Moscow's last-minute demand a bad-faith *"manipulation"*</span>
- <span style="color:blue">*"They are already trying to distort agreements…deceive…the world,"* Zelensky says in his nightly address, stressing that the truce carried **no hidden concessions** from Ukraine's side</span>
- <span style="color:red">Both Kyiv and Moscow make it clear that they expect the U.S. to enforce compliance: each side is skeptical the other will hold fire without American pressure</span>
- <span style="color:red">Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov bluntly states that only an "order from Washington to Zelenskiy" would ensure Ukrainian compliance</span>
- <span style="color:blue">For his part, Zelensky warns if Russia violates the deal, he'd urge Trump to re-freeze sanctions or send more weapons</span>
- <span style="color:blue">In the first hours after the ceasefires are declared, both sides accuse each other of sporadic drone attacks – yet notably **no new strikes are reported on energy facilities or shipping**</span>

<summary><strong>March 25, 2025 – Congressional Grilling over Signal Leak</strong></summary>

- <span style="color:red">The same day the ceasefire deal is unveiled, the Senate Intelligence Committee holds a heated hearing probing the Signal chat leak and the administration's handling of classified info</span>
- <span style="color:red">The same day the ceasefire deal is unveiled, the Senate Intelligence Committee holds a heated hearing probing the Signal chat leak and the administration's handling of classified info</span>
- <span style="color:red">CIA Director John Ratcliffe and DNI Tulsi Gabbard testify, facing bipartisan outrage just 24 hours after Goldberg's story broke</span>
- <span style="color:red">Ratcliffe maintains, *"My communications... in a Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information."*</span>
- <span style="color:red">Gabbard refuses to even confirm if she was part of the group chat (though Goldberg's article identified her as one of 18 participants), but likewise insists she'd never share classified intel improperly</span>
- <span style="color:blue">Senators are unconvinced. Ranking Member Mark Warner scolds the officials, saying *"If there was no classified material, share it with the committee…You can't have it both ways."*</span>
- <span style="color:blue">Lawmakers stress that even if the exact text wasn't formally classified, discussing live military operations on an unofficial app was a severe security lapse</span>
- <span style="color:blue">Multiple senators cite the incident as symptomatic of larger chaos in Trump's national security process</span>
- <span style="color:blue">Comparisons are drawn to historical blunders – some liken it to officials leaving a war plan on a café table, others evoke Hillary Clinton's email saga, pointing out the irony of Trump officials now caught using insecure channels</span>
- <span style="color:blue">Former officials testify that *any* leak of operational details is extremely dangerous, potentially tipping off adversaries</span>
- <span style="color:red">The Pentagon's inspector general opens an inquiry into how the Yemen planning was handled</span>

<summary><strong>March 28, 2025 – Allies and Experts Warn Against "Bad Peace"</strong></summary>

- <span style="color:blue">By late March, while Washington touts partial progress, U.S. allies in Europe grow more vocally concerned about the trajectory of Trump's diplomacy</span>
- <span style="color:blue">Many fear that an interim ceasefire would freeze the conflict on Russia's terms</span>
- <span style="color:blue">Defense ministers of the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania) warn that any Ukraine ceasefire now would **dramatically increase the threat to NATO's eastern flank**, as Russia could use a lull to rebuild forces and redeploy units right up to their borders</span>
- <span style="color:blue">They publicly push back against what they perceive as a premature deal, invoking history: Eastern Europeans see echoes of past "betrayals" when great powers negotiate over their heads</span>
- <span style="color:blue">Indeed, commentators in the West openly compare Trump's approach to **Neville Chamberlain's 1938 appeasement at Munich**</span>
- <span style="color:blue">Influential columnist Robert Kagan writes that Trump is effectively offering Putin "a Munich-like settlement" – giving Putin almost everything he wants (Ukraine's neutrality, territory, sanctions relief) without securing any fundamental concessions</span>
- <span style="color:blue">The worry, Kagan and others argue, is that like Hitler in 1938, Putin would only be emboldened by Western concessions and use a ceasefire to prepare a bigger offensive later</span>
- <span style="color:blue">In EU capitals, there are also murmurs of discontent that Washington has not closely coordinated its moves – an EU official grumbles that the U.S. seems to be *"dictating terms to Kyiv"* that Europe might not endorse</span>
- <span style="color:blue">Internally, the Ukrainian government is careful: Zelensky walks a fine line of thanking Trump for peace efforts while also insisting no agreement would compromise Ukraine's sovereignty</span>

<summary><strong>March 30, 2025 – Trump's Frustration Grows, Threatens Tougher Stance</strong></summary>

- <span style="color:red">By the end of March, the anticipated breakthrough has not materialized, and President Trump pivots to a harder line publicly</span>
- <span style="color:red">In an interview aired March 30 on NBC News, Trump says he is *"pissed off"* at Putin over the slow pace of negotiations</span>
- <span style="color:red">In a sharp reversal of tone, he threatens to impose **severe secondary tariffs (25–50%) on any country buying Russian oil** if Moscow continues blocking a Ukraine ceasefire</span>
- <span style="color:red">*"If Russia and I are unable to make a deal… and if I think it was Russia's fault, I will put…a 25% to 50% tariff on all oil coming out of Russia,"* Trump warns, essentially aiming to squeeze Russia's main revenue source</span>
- <span style="color:red">He also reportedly bristles at Putin's dismissive comments about Zelensky's leadership, which had aired on Russian TV the week before</span>
- <span style="color:red">This saber-rattling marks a notable shift – after months of conciliatory gestures toward the Kremlin, Trump is now signaling possible punitive action</span>
- <span style="color:red">White House aides indicate Trump plans to speak directly with Putin again within days to convey his displeasure</span>
- <span style="color:blue">Analysts view the move as Trump attempting to regain leverage: the U.S. had offered carrots, now comes the stick</span>
- <span style="color:blue">The threat of oil tariffs particularly grabs Europe's attention, as it could roil global energy markets</span>
- <span style="color:blue">Some in Washington see the tough talk as too little, too late – essentially acknowledging that Putin is *dragging his feet* on peace (a fact U.S. intelligence had long suggested)</span>

## **Assessment: The Systematic Capitulation (January 20 - August 11, 2025)**

Over 204 days, the Trump administration executed what can only be described as a systematic dismantling of U.S. opposition to Russian aggression:

### **The Numbers Tell the Story:**
- **Actions Benefiting Russia: 31** (one every 6.6 days)
- **Actions Benefiting America/Ukraine: 2.5** (one every 81.6 days)
- **Ratio: 12.4 to 1 in Russia's favor**

### **The Demolition Pattern:**

**Week 1:** Froze $16.4B in Ukraine aid, purged 160 NSC officials handling Russia policy
**Month 1:** Dismantled USAID, installed Russia-sympathetic leadership (Gabbard, Patel), began prisoner exchanges favoring Moscow
**Month 2:** Cut military aid, intelligence sharing, and satellite access to Ukraine while proposing Russia rejoin G7
**Months 3-7:** Issued 5 sanctions waivers while making only 1 new designation, endorsed Russian territorial gains, repeatedly threatened but never implemented serious consequences

### **The Meetings That Mattered:**
- **Saudi Arabia:** U.S.-Russia talks without Ukraine
- **White House:** Zelenskyy publicly humiliated and expelled
- **Moscow:** Witkoff praises Putin as "super smart, not a bad guy"
- **Alaska:** Putin welcomed on American soil with zero preconditions

### **The Threats That Weren't:**
While Trump posted increasingly desperate messages ("Vladimir, STOP!" "Putin has gone CRAZY!"), he systematically:
- Threatened 100% tariffs on Russian oil buyers → **Never implemented**
- Promised banking restrictions → **Never enacted**
- Set multiple "final" deadlines → **All passed without action**
- Warned of secondary sanctions → **Only hit India, after summit**

### **The Strategic Surrender:**
By scheduling the Alaska summit for August 15—before any threatened measures could take effect—Trump handed Putin his greatest diplomatic victory since the invasion began. Putin arrives knowing:
- The U.S. has already endorsed territorial swaps
- Ukraine's military intelligence is compromised
- American cyber operations against Russia are suspended
- Five sanctions waivers are active
- Every U.S. threat has proven hollow

### **The Historical Parallel:**
This isn't just diplomatic weakness—it's active enablement. Where Churchill warned against feeding the crocodile hoping to be eaten last, Trump appears to be seasoning himself. The administration didn't merely fail to confront Russian aggression; it systematically removed every obstacle in Putin's path while undermining America's own ally.

**The Bottom Line:** In 204 days, through 31 concrete actions favoring Russia against 2.5 favoring America, the Trump administration transformed the United States from Ukraine's essential defender into Russia's de facto ally. The Alaska summit isn't a negotiation—it's a surrender ceremony, and Trump is bringing the white flag.
