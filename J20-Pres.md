<summary><strong>January 21-22, 2025 – Foreign Aid Freeze and NSC Purge</strong></summary>

- <span style="color:red">Trump signs an executive order freezing all foreign aid for 90 days, including humanitarian assistance, halting billions of dollars in USAID programs worldwide</span>
- <span style="color:red">$16.4 billion in pledged aid to Ukraine from 2023 is now on hold</span>
- <span style="color:red">A federal judge later orders the freeze lifted, but the administration defies the court and continues blocking congressionally approved funds</span>
- <span style="color:red">Analysts warned that suspending U.S. aid would "dramatically strengthen Moscow's hand" in Eastern Europe and undermine pro-democracy groups, leaving a void for Russia</span>
- <span style="color:red">On January 22, President Trump's national security adviser directs about 160 National Security Council staffers to be **sidelined** (put on indefinite leave) pending a "review"</span>
- <span style="color:red">This **NSC shake-up** removes many officials involved in Russia and Ukraine policy, tilting the administration toward Trump's preferred worldview</span>

<summary><strong>January 23-24, 2025 – Security Leadership Changes</strong></summary>

- <span style="color:red">Senate narrowly confirms Pete Hegseth (51–50) as Secretary of Defense, with Vice President Vance casting the tie-breaker</span>

- <span style="color:red">Trump fires inspectors general of over a dozen federal agencies, removing many officials involved in overseeing foreign interference and national security issues</span>
- <span style="color:red">These moves install military leadership more aligned with Trump's worldview. While not explicitly pro-Russian, the shakeup removes voices (like Gen. Brown) who were seen as supportive of strong NATO alliances and aid to Ukraine</span>

- <span style="color:red">This halt threatens **U.S. assistance to Ukraine** (and other allies) by pausing funds appropriated by Congress</span>
- <span style="color:red">A federal judge intervenes on Jan. 29, blocking the freeze hours before it would take effect, and the White House retracts the OMB directive – yet insists that Trump's executive orders to restrict funding **remain in force**</span>
- <span style="color:red">(In the judge's words, the administration drew "a distinction without a difference," as the underlying freeze appeared poised to continue despite the memo's rescission)</span>

- <span style="color:red">He installs Secretary of State Marco Rubio as *de facto* acting head of USAID and backs a plan by his "Government Efficiency" czar (Elon Musk) to **shut down the agency**</span>
- <span style="color:red">Within days, USAID announces nearly all of its staff worldwide will be placed on **administrative leave**, grinding to a halt U.S. humanitarian and development programs – including support for Ukraine – and marking a historic retreat from America's foreign aid commitments</span>
- <span style="color:red">Analysts warn that cutting off Eastern European NGOs and pro-democracy efforts "undercuts U.S. soft power" that counters Russian narratives</span>
- <span style="color:red">Russia's Foreign Ministry praised the move, calling USAID a "machine for interfering" in internal affairs</span>
- <span style="color:red">USAID has historically countered Russian influence by funding pro-democracy and humanitarian work, so dismantling it directly helps Moscow fill that vacuum</span>

- <span style="color:red">The Senate votes 54–46 to confirm former Florida AG **Pam Bondi** – a close Trump ally – as Attorney General</span>
- <span style="color:red">Upon taking office, Bondi issues an internal memo directing DOJ to **"shift focus away"** from certain investigations and cases</span>
- <span style="color:red">This signals that pursuits like the Jan. 6 prosecutions and probes into foreign influence (e.g. Russian election interference) will be deprioritized</span>
- <span style="color:red">Bondi's memo also disbands the FBI's Foreign Influence Task Force (FITF) and deprioritizes Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) prosecutions</span>
- <span style="color:red">The FITF had been established in 2017 after Russia's election interference, to investigate and disrupt foreign influence operations</span>
- <span style="color:red">Bondi's memo also eliminated Task Force KleptoCapture, created by the Biden DOJ in March 2022 to go after wealthy Russians' illicit assets and enforce the sweeping sanctions imposed on Russia for its war</span>
- <span style="color:red">The Senate confirms **Tulsi Gabbard** as Director of National Intelligence in a 52–48 vote</span>
- <span style="color:red">Gabbard, who has been criticized for echoing Kremlin talking points in the past, now oversees all U.S. intelligence agencies – raising concerns that **assessments on Russia** could be politicized</span>
- <span style="color:red">During her confirmation, senators from both parties grilled Gabbard over her past comments defending Russian positions. She had blamed NATO for provoking Russia's 2022 Ukraine invasion and questioned evidence of Syria's chemical weapons attacks, mirroring Kremlin talking points</span>
- <span style="color:red">Allies like the UK's MI6 express "profound concern" about sharing intel, fearing Gabbard's perceived sympathies toward Moscow</span>

- <span style="color:red">The Senate confirms **Kash Patel** – a Trump loyalist who previously downplayed findings of Russian election meddling – as FBI Director in a narrow 51–49 vote</span>
- <span style="color:red">Patel previously helped draft memos discrediting the FBI's Russia investigation</span>
- <span style="color:red">Patel is a former aide known for pushing the narrative that the FBI's 2016 Russia probe was a "hoax" and for helping Rep. Devin Nunes draft the controversial 2018 memo that sought to discredit the FBI and Justice Department's handling of the Russia investigation</span>
- <span style="color:red">His background is "overtly partisan" and he has "a long history of conspiracy theorizing," including efforts to "discredit" investigations into Russian election interference</span>
- <span style="color:red">Civil rights and government watchdog groups uniformly opposed Patel's nomination, with one coalition warning that his confirmation would "cripple the FBI's impartiality" in matters of political corruption and foreign influence</span>

- <span style="color:red">On the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion, French President Emmanuel **Macron** visits Washington to urge Trump not to abandon Ukraine</span>
- <span style="color:red">In a joint press conference, Trump touts progress toward a peace deal and pointedly refers to European aid to Ukraine as essentially a **"loan"** that will be repaid – contrasting it with U.S. support</span>
- <span style="color:red">That same day, the U.S. shocks allies by **voting against a U.N. resolution condemning Russia's invasion** of Ukraine, arguing that focus should shift to peace terms</span>

- <span style="color:red">Trump announces he will appoint conservative media personality **Dan Bongino** as Deputy Director of the FBI</span>
- <span style="color:red">Bongino, a fervent Trump defender with little high-level law enforcement experience, is set to serve under Director Patel</span>
- <span style="color:red">The appointment further **politicizes FBI leadership** – potentially undermining investigations, including those related to Russian espionage</span>
- <span style="color:red">Both Patel and Bongino have publicly called the Russia probe a "hoax." Analysts expect U.S. vigilance toward Russian threats to diminish</span>

- <span style="color:red">As Zelenskyy cautions against trusting Putin, Trump abruptly **scraps a planned U.S.–Ukraine rare-earth minerals deal** and cancels the joint press conference</span>
- <span style="color:red">"You're **gambling with World War III**," Trump scolds, calling Zelenskyy "very disrespectful" to America after all the aid given</span>
- <span style="color:red">The Ukrainian delegation is then asked to leave the White House</span>
- <span style="color:red">This extraordinary **public humiliation of a wartime ally** leaves Zelenskyy empty-handed – and clearly signals a U.S. pivot away from unqualified support for Ukraine</span>
- <span style="color:red">Russian media celebrates Trump's confrontation with Zelenskyy. Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov praises Trump's approach</span>

- <span style="color:red">The White House portrays the pause as a move to ensure aid is "contributing to a solution" and to pressure Kyiv to **come to the negotiating table** on Washington's terms</span>
- <span style="color:red">The directive, made just days after Trump had personally castigated Zelenskyy, makes good on his implicit threat to leverage U.S. support</span>
- <span style="color:red">At the same time – behind closed doors – Trump officials accelerate work on a proposal to **lift selected sanctions on Russia** as part of a potential peace package, including relief for certain Russian oligarchs and energy firms</span>

## **Conclusion**

<span style="color:red">
From January 20 to March 7, 2025, the Trump administration has taken multiple actions that align with Russian strategic interests:

1. **Security apparatus restructuring**: Purging career experts from national security positions and installing loyalists who have historically downplayed Russian threats

2. **Aid suspension**: Freezing and then suspending critical military, financial, and intelligence support to Ukraine

3. **Diplomatic realignment**: Engaging directly with Russia while sidelining Ukraine, voting against UN resolutions condemning Russia, and questioning NATO commitments

4. **Enforcement reduction**: Dismantling task forces that investigated foreign influence and enforced sanctions against Russian oligarchs

5. **Mixed messaging**: Publicly threatening new sanctions while simultaneously planning sanctions relief and cutting off Ukraine's support systems
</span>

<span style="color:blue">
While the administration occasionally uses tough rhetoric regarding Russia, particularly in the March 7 statements about potential new sanctions, these verbal threats contrast sharply with the administration's actual policy actions.
</span>

<span style="color:red">
Each of these developments has been welcomed by Moscow while causing alarm among Western allies. While framed as "peace-seeking" or "America First" policies, these actions have consistently weakened Ukraine's position while strengthening Russia's hand both on the battlefield and at the negotiating table.
