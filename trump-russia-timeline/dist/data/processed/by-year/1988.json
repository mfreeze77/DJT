      "description": "Trump acquires the historic Plaza Hotel in Manhattan for a record-breaking $407.5 million, at the time the highest price ever paid for a hotel. He financed the purchase almost entirely with borrowed money (around $425 million in loans from a bank consortium led by Citibank), putting up minimal equity of his own. Trump installs his wife Ivana as president of the hotel, promising to restore it to unprecedented luxury. Industry observers criticized the purchase as financially unsound, as the Plaza's cash flow was insufficient to cover even the interest payments on its enormous debt.",

The transaction was highly leveraged, with Trump borrowing approximately $425 million from a bank consortium led by Citibank, putting up minimal equity of his own. The purchase price was widely considered excessive, as the property had sold just four years earlier for $287 million. The Plaza's cash flow was insufficient to cover even the interest payments on its enormous debt, making it financially unsustainable from the beginning."
