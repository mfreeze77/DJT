      "description": "Trump partners with Holiday Inn / Harrah's to develop his first Atlantic City casino, financed through a major corporate investment and regulated by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission. This partnership represents Trump's entry into the gaming industry, with Holiday Inn/Harrah's providing the majority of capital and gaming expertise while Trump contributes the land and project oversight. The casino would later open in 1984 as 'Harrah's at Trump Plaza' before Trump buys out his partners in 1986.",

The financial structure was a joint venture where Trump contributed the land and project oversight while Holiday Inn/Harrah's provided the majority of the capital and gaming expertise. This arrangement allowed Trump to establish a foothold in the lucrative casino business with minimal upfront investment of his own capital, leveraging his brand and real estate expertise instead."
