        "description": "The construction of Trump Tower represented a major investment, with an estimated cost of around $200 million. The financial structure was a partnership between Trump and Equitable Life Assurance, where Equitable contributed the valuable Fifth Avenue land (the former Bonwit Teller building site) in exchange for a 50% ownership stake. This arrangement allowed Trump to develop a prestigious Manhattan skyscraper without having to purchase the extremely expensive land outright, while Equitable received half-ownership of what would become an iconic New York property. The project significantly elevated Trump's status and brand in the real estate world."
