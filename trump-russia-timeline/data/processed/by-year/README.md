## Event ID System

The timeline implements a sequential event ID numbering system:

1. **Consolidated Events**: Events covering the same occurrence across multiple sources have been merged to prevent duplication (e.g., Trump Tower completion appears as a single comprehensive event rather than multiple partial entries).

2. **Sequential Numbering**: Events are numbered consecutively from event-001 through event-060 (as of 2008), providing a chronological backbone for the entire timeline.

3. **Cross-References**: All relationships, transactions, and related events maintain proper cross-references to preserve the connections between timeline elements.

4. **ID Format**: All event IDs follow the pattern "event-XXX" where XXX is a sequential number.

This ID system ensures consistency across the timeline and facilitates proper event linking and relationship mapping.
