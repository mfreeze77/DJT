      "description": "Trump travels to Moscow and Leningrad with Ivana at the invitation of the Soviet government. The trip is arranged and hosted by Intourist (the Soviet state travel agency known to be a KGB front) to discuss building a luxury hotel near Red Square. Trump receives VIP treatment and tours potential hotel sites. According to former KGB operatives, Trump was likely surveilled during his stay and possibly fed talking points encouraging him to enter politics. Though no Moscow project materialized at the time, this trip marked Trump's first direct engagement with Soviet officials at the height of the Cold War.",

This form of hospitality, valued at approximately $50,000, represented an investment by the Soviet government in cultivating Trump as a business partner and potentially as a political asset. As standard Soviet practice for high-profile foreign visitors, this all-expenses-paid luxury treatment was designed to impress Trump and make him favorably disposed toward Soviet interests."
