This project was made possible through an unprecedented 40-year tax abatement from New York City, a partnership with the Pritzker family's Hyatt Hotels, and innovative public-private financing through the New York State Urban Development Corporation. The deal featured a $70 million construction loan jointly guaranteed by Fred Trump and Hyatt, with the UDC acquiring the hotel and leasing it back to Trump and Hyatt tax-free for 40 years. This project launched Trump's public reputation as a major developer and demonstrated his ability to leverage political connections, family resources, and public subsidies for private gain.",

The Pritzker family (Trump's partners in the Grand Hyatt) established multiple Bermuda-based companies in 1980, including Western International Financial Group Ltd. and THL Ltd., indicating early offshore financial activity by Trump's close business partners. Simultaneously, following Trump's 1977 marriage to Czech-born Ivana Zelníčková, the Czechoslovak State Security (StB) had begun surveilling the couple. By 1980, their surveillance intensified with Ivana's father Miloš Zelníček serving as an informant, providing the StB with updates on Trump's business dealings and personal life. The StB routinely shared this intelligence with the Soviet KGB, effectively putting Trump on Moscow's radar even before his 1987 Moscow visit.",
