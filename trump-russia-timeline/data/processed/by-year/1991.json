      "description": "Just 15 months after its grand opening, the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Unable to generate enough revenue to cover the $675 million in high-interest junk bonds used to finance its construction, the casino defaulted on its debt payments. As part of the restructuring plan, Trump gave up 50% ownership to bondholders in exchange for reduced interest rates and extended payment terms. This marked the first of four business bankruptcies Trump would experience in the early 1990s, as his highly leveraged empire began to collapse.",
