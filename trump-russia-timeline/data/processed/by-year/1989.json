      "description": "Trump acquires Eastern Air Lines Shuttle for $365 million and rebrands it as Trump Shuttle. The purchase, financed largely through loans from a bank consortium, includes 21 Boeing 727 aircraft and the valuable landing slots at major airports in the Northeast corridor. Trump invests millions more in gold-colored exterior logos and maple-wood veneer interiors to create a luxury image. The airline struggles financially from the start, unable to service its high debt load in the competitive airline market.",

Trump paid a premium price (approximately $7 million more than what Eastern's CEO Frank Lorenzo thought it was worth) and invested additional millions in luxury upgrades like gold logos and maple veneer interiors. The highly leveraged acquisition would struggle financially from the start, losing approximately $34 million in its first six months of operation, and would ultimately be turned over to creditors in 1991."
