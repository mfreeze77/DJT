# Key Figures in Donald Trump’s Financial Dealings (1986–1989)

## Roy Cohn (Attorney and Mentor)  
- **Background and Association with Trump**: Roy Cohn rose to notoriety as a prosecutor in the Rosenberg spy trial and as Senator Joseph McCarthy’s chief counsel during the 1950s Red Scare ([Roy Cohn: From 'Red Scare' Prosecutor to Donald Trump's Mentor | HISTORY](https://www.history.com/news/roy-cohn-mccarthyism-rosenberg-trial-donald-trump#:~:text=Cohn%20was%20a%20prosecutor%20in,Gay%20Fantasia%20on%20National%20Themes)). By the 1970s and ’80s, he was an influential New York power lawyer, counting celebrities and politicians among his clients. Cohn met a young Donald Trump in 1973 at the Le Club in Manhattan and soon became Trump’s personal attorney after advising him to aggressively fight a federal housing discrimination suit ([Roy Cohn: From 'Red Scare' Prosecutor to Donald Trump's Mentor | HISTORY](https://www.history.com/news/roy-cohn-mccarthyism-rosenberg-trial-donald-trump#:~:text=Fast%20forward%20to%20Manhattan%2C%201973,%E2%80%9D)) ([Roy Cohn: From 'Red Scare' Prosecutor to Donald Trump's Mentor | HISTORY](https://www.history.com/news/roy-cohn-mccarthyism-rosenberg-trial-donald-trump#:~:text=allegations%20that%20his%20real%20estate,%E2%80%9D)). He thereafter served as Trump’s mentor and fixer, introducing Trump to key figures (such as political consultant Roger Stone) and helping him navigate New York’s power circles ([Roy Cohn: From 'Red Scare' Prosecutor to Donald Trump's Mentor | HISTORY](https://www.history.com/news/roy-cohn-mccarthyism-rosenberg-trial-donald-trump#:~:text=Soon%20afterward%2C%20Cohn%20started%20working,who%20advised%20his%20presidential%20campaign)). 

- **Role in Trump’s Dealings and Relationship**: As Trump’s lawyer through the 1970s and early ’80s, Cohn was instrumental in Trump’s early real estate expansion. He negotiated deals, fought legal battles on Trump’s behalf, and secured political favors (for example, he helped Trump obtain tax abatements for projects like the Grand Hyatt) ([The Final Lesson Donald Trump Never Learned From Roy Cohn - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/09/19/roy-cohn-donald-trump-documentary-228144#:~:text=%E2%80%9CRoy%2C%E2%80%9D%20according%20to%20an%20attorney,%E2%80%9D)) ([Roy Cohn: From 'Red Scare' Prosecutor to Donald Trump's Mentor | HISTORY](https://www.history.com/news/roy-cohn-mccarthyism-rosenberg-trial-donald-trump#:~:text=Soon%20afterward%2C%20Cohn%20started%20working,who%20advised%20his%20presidential%20campaign)). Cohn was known for his ruthless, rule-bending tactics and “jugular” approach, traits that deeply influenced Trump’s own style ([The Final Lesson Donald Trump Never Learned From Roy Cohn - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/09/19/roy-cohn-donald-trump-documentary-228144#:~:text=%E2%80%9CHe%20was%20a%20prototypical%20Teflon,%E2%80%9D)) ([Roy Cohn: From 'Red Scare' Prosecutor to Donald Trump's Mentor | HISTORY](https://www.history.com/news/roy-cohn-mccarthyism-rosenberg-trial-donald-trump#:~:text=Soon%20afterward%2C%20Cohn%20started%20working,who%20advised%20his%20presidential%20campaign)). Their relationship was personal as well as professional: Trump admired Cohn’s toughness and clout, and Cohn in turn cultivated Trump’s rise. Cohn also had infamy beyond Trump, representing clients ranging from the Catholic Archdiocese to mafia bosses like “Fat Tony” Salerno ([Roy Cohn: From 'Red Scare' Prosecutor to Donald Trump's Mentor | HISTORY](https://www.history.com/news/roy-cohn-mccarthyism-rosenberg-trial-donald-trump#:~:text=Trump%20was%20one%20of%20many,Galante%20and%20%E2%80%9CFat%20Tony%E2%80%9D%20Salerno)), which underscored his behind-the-scenes influence in New York.

- **Downfall and Aftermath**: By the mid-1980s, Cohn’s legal troubles and health issues escalated. He was diagnosed with AIDS in 1984 and was **disbarred in 1986** for unethical conduct ([Roy Cohn: From 'Red Scare' Prosecutor to Donald Trump's Mentor | HISTORY](https://www.history.com/news/roy-cohn-mccarthyism-rosenberg-trial-donald-trump#:~:text=Shortly%20before%20his%20death%20in,Post%20reported%20at%20the%20time)). During Cohn’s decline, Trump gradually distanced himself from his former mentor. Cohn died in August 1986, ending the 13-year association ([Roy Cohn: From 'Red Scare' Prosecutor to Donald Trump's Mentor | HISTORY](https://www.history.com/news/roy-cohn-mccarthyism-rosenberg-trial-donald-trump#:~:text=Cohn%20was%20a%20prosecutor%20in,Gay%20Fantasia%20on%20National%20Themes)). Trump later reflected on Cohn’s impact on him, acknowledging Cohn’s combative strategy. Cohn’s legacy remains that of a controversial fixer whose tactics shaped Trump’s approach to business conflicts ([Roy Cohn: From 'Red Scare' Prosecutor to Donald Trump's Mentor | HISTORY](https://www.history.com/news/roy-cohn-mccarthyism-rosenberg-trial-donald-trump#:~:text=Soon%20afterward%2C%20Cohn%20started%20working,who%20advised%20his%20presidential%20campaign)) ([The Final Lesson Donald Trump Never Learned From Roy Cohn - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/09/19/roy-cohn-donald-trump-documentary-228144#:~:text=%E2%80%9CHe%20was%20a%20prototypical%20Teflon,%E2%80%9D)), even as Cohn himself faced a disgraced end.

## Ivana Trump (Wife and Business Associate)  
- **Background and Association with Trump**: Ivana Trump (née Zelníčková) was a former Czech athlete and model who married Donald Trump in 1977 ([Ivana Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivana_Trump#:~:text=Ivana%20Marie%20Trump%20%28n%C3%A9e%20%C2%A0Zeln%C3%AD%C4%8Dkov%C3%A1%3B,manager%20of%20the%20%20123)). With a sharp business sense of her own, she became an integral part of the Trump Organization throughout the 1980s. Ivana took on senior executive roles in her husband’s enterprises, bringing both glamour and work ethic. By the mid-1980s, she was a fixture in New York’s social and business scene, often seen as the polished partner behind Trump’s public persona ([Ivana Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivana_Trump#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%20%20in%201977,manager%20of%20the%20Plaza%20Hotel)) ([Ivana Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivana_Trump#:~:text=Ivana%20and%20Donald%20Trump%20were,and%20the%20autobiography%20%20127)).

- **Role in Trump’s Financial Dealings**: During 1986–1989, Ivana held **key managerial positions** in Trump’s empire. She served as **president of Trump’s Castle Casino** in Atlantic City and later as **manager (CEO) of the Plaza Hotel** in Manhattan after Trump bought it in 1988 ([Ivana Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivana_Trump#:~:text=During%20her%20marriage%20to%20Donald%2C,44)) ([Ivana Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivana_Trump#:~:text=executive%20vice%20president%20for%20interior,44)). In these roles, she oversaw operations, renovation projects, and interior design (her design imprint was notable in Trump Tower’s opulent decor) ([Ivana Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivana_Trump#:~:text=During%20her%20marriage%20to%20Donald%2C,44)). Ivana was known to be a hands-on executive: she could often be found walking construction sites in heels and a hardhat, ensuring Trump projects met her standards ([Trump and the Artifice of the Deal - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-father-artifice-of-the-deal-213888#:~:text=sturdy%2C%20middle,heels%2C%20a%20dress%20and%20a)) ([Trump and the Artifice of the Deal - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-father-artifice-of-the-deal-213888#:~:text=The%20structure%20that%20the%20Trumps,a%20more%20chic%20Park%20Avenue)). Her involvement lent Trump’s ventures an air of sophistication and helped improve their profitability during the late ’80s. The Trumps were a true “power couple” of the 1980s, frequently appearing together at events and on television ([Ivana Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivana_Trump#:~:text=ImageIvana%20at%20the%20Life%20Ball,2009%20in%20%20202)).

- **Relationship and Aftermath**: Ivana’s business and personal relationship with Donald began to strain by the end of the 1980s. The couple’s high-profile **divorce in 1990** ended both their marriage and Ivana’s formal role in the Trump Organization ([Ivana Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivana_Trump#:~:text=Ivana%20and%20Donald%20Trump%20were,and%20the%20autobiography%20%20127)). She left the company with a hefty settlement and goodwill for her management contributions. Post-Trump, Ivana pursued her own entrepreneurial endeavors – launching fashion and jewelry lines and writing books ([Ivana Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivana_Trump#:~:text=Ivana%20and%20Donald%20Trump%20were,and%20the%20autobiography%20%20127)). Publicly, she maintained a persona as a savvy businesswoman in her own right. Her legacy in Trump’s late-’80s dealings is that of a formidable partner who helped execute his grand visions (like the Plaza Hotel’s revitalization ([Trump is forced to resell the Plaza Hotel - CultureNow - Museum Without Walls ](https://culturenow.org/site/54bc1b75-8fd5-4155-9e64-3bfb7e5a1497#:~:text=The%20Plaza%20was%20sold%20to,Trump%27s%20purchase%2C%20largely%20from%20increased))) and set a template for the Trump brand’s luxury image.

## Fred Trump (Father and Financial Backer)  
- **Background**: Fred C. Trump was a successful New York real estate developer who built middle-class housing in the outer boroughs from the 1930s onward ([Fred Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Trump#:~:text=Fred%27s%20son%2C%20Donald%2C%20joined%20his,estate%20business%20around%201968)) ([Fred Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Trump#:~:text=Manhattan%2C%20while%20his%20father%20operated,Fred%20planned%20the%20expansion%20of)). By the 1970s, he was a wealthy and politically connected landlord known for large housing projects in Brooklyn and Queens. He groomed Donald as his business successor; Donald became president of Fred’s company in 1971, and Fred remained a constant behind-the-scenes advisor ([Fred Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Trump#:~:text=Senate%20committee%20in%201954%20and,racial%20discrimination%20against%20black%20people)) ([Fred Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Trump#:~:text=Trump%20%20states%20that%20he,28)). Fred’s extensive network and conservative business approach provided a foundation for Donald’s riskier Manhattan ventures.

- **Role in Donald’s Financial Dealings**: During the 1986–1989 period, Fred Trump served as an **informal financier and guarantor** for many of Donald’s projects. He had been “behind [Donald] in every way…including financing of these developments,” as a Trump Organization VP later noted ([Fred Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Trump#:~:text=Trump%20%20states%20that%20he,28)). For example, **Fred helped guarantee loans** for Trump’s early deals like the Grand Hyatt hotel – Fred and Hyatt CEO Jay Pritzker personally guaranteed the $70 million construction loan when banks were skeptical of young Donald ([Trump and the Artifice of the Deal - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-father-artifice-of-the-deal-213888#:~:text=support%20Barrett%20reports%20was%20key,own%20the%20hotel)) ([Trump and the Artifice of the Deal - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-father-artifice-of-the-deal-213888#:~:text=By%201976%2C%20the%20%244,and%20Hyatt%20chief%20Jay%20Pritzker)). Throughout the ’80s, whenever Donald needed liquidity or credibility with lenders, Fred stepped in. In 1987, as Donald’s debt to his father grew past $11 million, Fred invested $15.5 million in Donald’s Trump Palace project, effectively bolstering his son’s finances ([Fred Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Trump#:~:text=In%201987%2C%20when%20Donald%27s%20loan,The%20state%27s)). Fred’s presence reassured banks and partners; his decades-old contacts (for instance, at Equitable Life Insurance and Chase Bank) were leveraged to secure financing for Donald’s ambitious acquisitions ([Trump and the Artifice of the Deal - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-father-artifice-of-the-deal-213888#:~:text=support%20Barrett%20reports%20was%20key,own%20the%20hotel)) ([Trump and the Artifice of the Deal - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-father-artifice-of-the-deal-213888#:~:text=When%20the%20project%20ran%20over,%E2%80%9D)).

- **Nature of Relationship and Aftermath**: Fred and Donald’s relationship was both familial and business-oriented. Fred often acted as a safety net: famously, when the newly opened Trump Taj Mahal casino was in trouble, Fred provided a quick $3.5 million by purchasing casino chips (never intended to be gambled) to meet a cash reserve requirement ([When Donald Comes to Town](https://jacobin.com/2016/08/trump-atlantic-city-casinos-taj-mahal-bankruptcy/#:~:text=By%20the%20time%20he%20announced,by%20Fred%20Trump%2C%20Donald%E2%80%99s%20father)) ([Fred Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Trump#:~:text=from%20a%20legally%20questionable%20write,126)). (Regulators later ruled this an illegal loan, and the casino paid a fine ([Fred Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Trump#:~:text=from%20a%20legally%20questionable%20write,126)).) Fred’s interventions helped delay or avert financial crises for Donald in the late ’80s. As Donald’s empire faltered in the early ’90s, Fred’s wealth was further used (sometimes through opaque means) to support his children ([Fred Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Trump#:~:text=Contradicting%20Donald%20Trump%27s%20claim%20that,their%20children%20overall%2C%20avoiding%20over)) ([Fred Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Trump#:~:text=In%201987%2C%20when%20Donald%27s%20loan,transaction%20to%20constitute%20an%20illegal)). Fred Trump passed away in 1999, but an **October 2018 New York Times investigation** revealed he had funnelled extraordinary sums (over $400 million in 2018 dollars) to Donald over the decades, far beyond the “small loan” Donald often mentioned ([Fred Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Trump#:~:text=Contradicting%20Donald%20Trump%27s%20claim%20that,their%20children%20overall%2C%20avoiding%20over)) ([Fred Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Trump#:~:text=In%20the%20mid,9%20million)). In sum, between 1986 and 1989, Fred Trump was the quiet but crucial financial backer enabling Donald’s high-leverage expansions – a role that kept Donald’s ventures afloat and shaped his penchant for using family wealth as a springboard.

## Jay Pritzker (Business Partner – Grand Hyatt Hotel)  
- **Background and Association with Trump**: Jay Pritzker was a prominent businessman best known as the patriarch of the Pritzker family and the head of Hyatt Hotels. By the late 1970s, Pritzker was looking to establish a Hyatt presence in New York City. He found an unlikely partner in Donald Trump, who in 1976–78 had optioned the derelict Commodore Hotel by Grand Central Terminal ([Trump and the Artifice of the Deal - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-father-artifice-of-the-deal-213888#:~:text=to%20buy%20the%20dated%201919,into%20a%20shiny%20Hyatt%20Hotel)) ([Trump and the Artifice of the Deal - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-father-artifice-of-the-deal-213888#:~:text=Young%20Donald%20was%20not%20an,vertical%20atrium%20lobby%E2%80%94jibed%20with%20Trump%E2%80%99s)). Pritzker and Trump joined forces to redevelop it into the Grand Hyatt, which opened in 1980. Though this partnership was forged slightly earlier, Pritzker remained Trump’s **co-owner** in the hotel throughout the 1980s, sharing profits and management decisions. The teaming of Trump (a young, brash developer) and Pritzker (established hotel mogul) was facilitated by New York officials eager to revive the city’s economy ([Trump and the Artifice of the Deal - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-father-artifice-of-the-deal-213888#:~:text=to%20buy%20the%20dated%201919,into%20a%20shiny%20Hyatt%20Hotel)) ([Trump and the Artifice of the Deal - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-father-artifice-of-the-deal-213888#:~:text=support%20Barrett%20reports%20was%20key,own%20the%20hotel)).

- **Role in Trump’s Financial Dealings**: Pritzker’s role was as a **financier and mentor-partner** on a major Trump project. He brought significant capital and credibility to the Grand Hyatt deal. Notably, **Pritzker (along with Fred Trump) personally guaranteed the $70 million construction loan** for the hotel when Donald could not secure bank financing on his own ([Trump and the Artifice of the Deal - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-father-artifice-of-the-deal-213888#:~:text=support%20Barrett%20reports%20was%20key,own%20the%20hotel)). This guarantee in 1978 enabled Trump to proceed with the redevelopment ([Trump and the Artifice of the Deal - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-father-artifice-of-the-deal-213888#:~:text=support%20Barrett%20reports%20was%20key,own%20the%20hotel)). Throughout the ’80s, Pritzker’s Hyatt Corporation operated the Grand Hyatt, splitting revenues with Trump. This partnership gave Trump a steady cash flow during the late 1980s and a foothold with a reputable hotel brand. However, tensions grew over time as Trump and Pritzker disagreed on profit-sharing and reinvestment – foreshadowing a clash.

- **Relationship and Aftermath**: The Trump-Pritzker relationship, while fruitful in early years, deteriorated by the end of the 1980s. Trump often chafed at sharing profits and in the early ’90s he accused Jay Pritzker of using accounting tactics to minimize Trump’s take – at one point Trump even sued Pritzker, accusing him of “blackmail” over their partnership ([Striking design to replace Trump's Grand Hyatt - ubm magazin.](https://www.ubm-development.com/magazin/en/striking-design-to-replace-trumps-grand-hyatt/#:~:text=development,filed%20a%20lawsuit%20against%20him)). Pritzker, for his part, was concerned about Trump’s heavy debt loads affecting the hotel’s stability. Ultimately, the partnership ended in 1995 when the Pritzkers’ Hyatt bought out Trump’s 50% stake in the Grand Hyatt (amid Trump’s financial struggles) ([Hyatt Grand Central New York - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyatt_Grand_Central_New_York#:~:text=With%20the%20deteriorating%20partnership%20between,in%20the%20hotel%20in%201996)). Jay Pritzker continued to lead Hyatt (and other ventures) until his death in 1999, remaining a respected figure. The Grand Hyatt venture is remembered as Trump’s first big success, made possible in large part by Jay Pritzker’s money and reputation ([Trump and the Artifice of the Deal - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-father-artifice-of-the-deal-213888#:~:text=support%20Barrett%20reports%20was%20key,own%20the%20hotel)). It highlights how Trump, during 1986–89, relied on seasoned partners like Pritzker to underwrite his bold real estate plays.

## Merv Griffin (Entertainment Mogul and Rival Casino Investor)  
- **Background**: Merv Griffin was a well-known television personality turned media mogul. By the 1980s he had created hit TV shows (“Jeopardy!” and “Wheel of Fortune”) and amassed a fortune. In 1988, Griffin set his sights on the casino industry and became an unexpected rival-turned-associate of Trump. The catalyst was Resorts International, a gaming company that owned Atlantic City’s first casino and had started building the ambitious Taj Mahal casino. After the death of Resorts’ founder James Crosby in 1986, control of the company was up for grabs ([When Donald Comes to Town](https://jacobin.com/2016/08/trump-atlantic-city-casinos-taj-mahal-bankruptcy/#:~:text=The%20project%20initially%20belonged%20to,were%20already%20beginning%20to%20plummet)). Trump began buying Resorts International stock, aiming to take over the half-finished Taj Mahal project. Griffin entered the fray in 1988, sparking a high-profile **bidding war** between the two colorful tycoons ([Trump Entertainment Resorts - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Entertainment_Resorts#:~:text=In%201988%2C%20Trump%20purchased%20the,6)).

- **Role in Trump’s Dealings**: Griffin and Trump’s showdown led to a **complex deal in 1988**. After months of legal wrangling and negotiations, the two reached a settlement to split Resorts International’s assets. **Trump relinquished Resorts International to Merv Griffin, while Trump took sole possession of the unfinished Taj Mahal casino** ([Trump Entertainment Resorts - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Entertainment_Resorts#:~:text=In%201988%2C%20Trump%20purchased%20the,6)). In effect, Griffin became the owner of Resorts’ other properties (including a Bahamas hotel-casino and Atlantic City’s Resorts Casino Hotel), and Trump got the prize he wanted – the Taj Mahal – without Griffin competing further. Both men claimed victory. This transaction was crucial for Trump: it cleared the way for him to proceed with completing the Taj Mahal, which opened in April 1990 as the world’s biggest casino. Griffin’s role as an investor provided a higher buyout price for Resorts’ shareholders, which indirectly raised the cost for Trump to acquire Taj. Griffin’s company paid a reported $365 million for Resorts International in the deal, illustrating his significant financial firepower in the late ’80s ([Trump Entertainment Resorts - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Entertainment_Resorts#:~:text=In%201988%2C%20Trump%20purchased%20the,6)).

- **Relationship and Outcome**: Initially adversarial, the Trump-Griffin relationship during 1988–89 was marked by public barbs and intense negotiation. Trump at one point sued Griffin to block his takeover attempt, and Griffin counter-sued – the conflict made headlines. Ultimately, they found a business compromise. **The agreement in late 1988 left Trump and Griffin with a working if cautious respect**; Griffin praised Trump’s beloved Taj as the “crown jewel of Atlantic City” even as he took control of the remaining Resorts assets ([Trouble with A Big T | TIME](https://time.com/archive/6715173/trouble-with-a-big-t/#:~:text=Trouble%20with%20A%20Big%20T,Trump%20getting%20the%20uncompleted)). After the dust settled, the two pursued separate paths: Trump went on to open the Taj (only to see it fall into bankruptcy shortly after), and Griffin attempted to turn around the aging Resorts International properties. Griffin’s casino foray was short-lived – by the early 1990s he exited the casino business and refocused on media, eventually selling his company to Coca-Cola in 1989 for $250 million. The Trump–Griffin episode stands out as a clash of titans that reshaped Atlantic City’s ownership landscape, demonstrating Trump’s willingness to engage and then deal with a rival to get what he wanted ([Trump Entertainment Resorts - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Entertainment_Resorts#:~:text=In%201988%2C%20Trump%20purchased%20the,6)).

## James Crosby (Resorts International Founder)  
- **Background**: James Crosby was a pioneering casino developer and chairman of Resorts International, the company that opened Atlantic City’s first casino in 1978. A former entertainment lawyer, Crosby had built Resorts International (originally a diversified company) into a major player in gambling, owning resorts in the Bahamas and Atlantic City. In the early 1980s, he embarked on building the **Taj Mahal Casino** in Atlantic City – an extravagant, costly project that was only partly completed by the mid-’80s. Crosby’s sudden death in April 1986 (during open-heart surgery) left Resorts International leaderless and its ambitious Taj project in limbo ([When Donald Comes to Town](https://jacobin.com/2016/08/trump-atlantic-city-casinos-taj-mahal-bankruptcy/#:~:text=James%20Crosby%2C%20died%20unexpectedly%20during,were%20already%20beginning%20to%20plummet)).

- **Connection to Trump**: Donald Trump’s involvement with Crosby’s empire came after Crosby’s death. Seeing an opportunity, Trump started buying Resorts International stock in 1986–87 to gain control of the half-built Taj Mahal ([When Donald Comes to Town](https://jacobin.com/2016/08/trump-atlantic-city-casinos-taj-mahal-bankruptcy/#:~:text=The%20project%20initially%20belonged%20to,were%20already%20beginning%20to%20plummet)). Crosby had not been directly partnered with Trump (in fact, they were competitors in Atlantic City), but Crosby’s passing set the stage for Trump’s crucial acquisition. Trump admired the Taj’s potential and moved quickly when Crosby was no longer at the helm. By 1987, Trump had acquired a significant stake in Resorts International and was maneuvering to take it over, which led to the confrontation with Merv Griffin described above. In this sense, James Crosby’s legacy – the Taj Mahal blueprint – became a key piece of Trump’s late-’80s expansion.

- **Aftermath**: While Crosby did not live to interact with Trump’s plans, the aftermath of his involvement is seen in how Resorts International was dismembered. Following the Trump-Griffin deal (1988), Resorts International’s original business was effectively split: Trump pushed the Taj Mahal to completion, and Griffin’s group managed the remaining resorts for a time. The Taj Mahal opened in 1990 touted as Crosby’s dream realized by Trump. However, its financial structure (heavy debt) led to bankruptcy within a year ([When Donald Comes to Town](https://jacobin.com/2016/08/trump-atlantic-city-casinos-taj-mahal-bankruptcy/#:~:text=By%20the%20time%20he%20announced,by%20Fred%20Trump%2C%20Donald%E2%80%99s%20father)). Resorts International’s other assets under Griffin also struggled in the changing casino market. James Crosby’s direct influence ended in 1986, but his **bold approach to casino development** (building “the world’s biggest casino” vision) heavily influenced Trump’s trajectory. Trump often cited the half-finished state of the Taj as something he could turn into a glittering success where Crosby’s company had faltered ([When Donald Comes to Town](https://jacobin.com/2016/08/trump-atlantic-city-casinos-taj-mahal-bankruptcy/#:~:text=The%20project%20initially%20belonged%20to,were%20already%20beginning%20to%20plummet)). In sum, Crosby was the behind-the-scenes originator of a project that became central to Trump’s 1986–1989 financial maneuvers.

## Michael Milken (“Junk Bond” Financier)  
- **Background**: Michael Milken was an innovative financier who led the high-yield bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert in the 1980s. Nicknamed the **“Junk Bond King,”** Milken revolutionized corporate finance by popularizing high-risk, high-yield bonds as a way to fund big projects and leveraged buyouts. By the late ’80s, Milken was one of Wall Street’s highest-paid figures and had fueled the expansion of many companies with junk bond financing ([Who is Michael Milken, the 'junk bond king' Trump just pardoned?](https://www.nationthailand.com/in-focus/30382382#:~:text=high,Wall%20Street)) ([Who is Michael Milken, the 'junk bond king' Trump just pardoned?](https://www.nationthailand.com/in-focus/30382382#:~:text=the%20villain%20in%20the%201987,Wall%20Street)). (He also became a target for prosecutors and would plead guilty to securities fraud in 1990 ([Who is Michael Milken, the 'junk bond king' Trump just pardoned?](https://www.nationthailand.com/in-focus/30382382#:~:text=In%201990%2C%20Milken%20pleaded%20guilty,and%20cooperating%20with%20government%20investigators)).)

- **Role in Trump’s Financial Strategies**: Donald Trump indirectly **benefited from Milken’s junk bond market** to finance his ventures. Notably, in 1988–89 Trump turned to high-yield bonds to finance the completion of the Taj Mahal casino. After promising New Jersey regulators that he would not rely on junk bonds for the Taj ([When Donald Comes to Town](https://jacobin.com/2016/08/trump-atlantic-city-casinos-taj-mahal-bankruptcy/#:~:text=In%201988%2C%20Trump%20convinced%20a,%E2%80%9D)), Trump did exactly that: he issued **$675 million in bonds at 14% interest** to raise capital ([Who is Michael Milken, the 'junk bond king' Trump just pardoned?](https://www.nationthailand.com/in-focus/30382382#:~:text=Trump%20was%20a%20benefactor%20of,The%20New%20York%20Times%20reported)). This unprecedented interest rate – about twice the going bank rate – was possible only in the climate Milken created. Drexel Burnham under Milken’s influence had made junk financing mainstream, allowing Trump (a relatively debt-laden developer by then) to tap public markets despite the risk. Essentially, Milken’s innovations provided Trump the money he couldn’t get from traditional banks to finish the Taj Mahal. However, the consequence was a massive debt burden: the Taj’s interest payments were around $95 million per year, which quickly proved unsustainable ([The Death of Roy Cohn, Resorts International, and Donald Trump's ...](https://medium.com/@petergrant_14485/the-death-of-roy-cohn-resorts-international-and-donald-trumps-financial-downfall-8058ddf860ca#:~:text=The%20Death%20of%20Roy%20Cohn%2C,million%20in%20annual%20interest)). The Taj Mahal declared bankruptcy in 1991, demonstrating the peril of Milken-style financing when revenue fell short.

- **Aftermath and Connections**: Milken himself was **indicted in 1989** and convicted in 1990 for securities violations unrelated to Trump ([Who is Michael Milken, the 'junk bond king' Trump just pardoned?](https://www.nationthailand.com/in-focus/30382382#:~:text=the%20villain%20in%20the%201987,Wall%20Street)). He served time in prison and later became a philanthropist. Decades later, President Trump notably **pardoned Michael Milken in 2020**, acknowledging the role of junk bonds in the economy ([Who is Michael Milken, the 'junk bond king' Trump just pardoned?](https://www.nationthailand.com/in-focus/30382382#:~:text=Before%20boarding%20Air%20Force%20One,of%20his%20research%20on%20cancer)) ([Who is Michael Milken, the 'junk bond king' Trump just pardoned?](https://www.nationthailand.com/in-focus/30382382#:~:text=Trump%20was%20a%20benefactor%20of,The%20New%20York%20Times%20reported)). While Milken and Trump did not have a personal relationship in the 1980s, Milken’s network (investment firms willing to buy junk bonds) and Drexel’s aggressive capital raising were crucial behind the scenes. The episode underscored Trump’s status as the “King of Debt,” willing to leverage new financial instruments. It also linked Trump to the broader story of the 1980s leverage boom and bust. Milken’s high-yield legacy thus left a mark on Trump’s 1986–89 expansion, funding Trump’s biggest casino even as it sowed the seeds of financial trouble ([Who is Michael Milken, the 'junk bond king' Trump just pardoned?](https://www.nationthailand.com/in-focus/30382382#:~:text=Trump%20was%20a%20benefactor%20of,The%20New%20York%20Times%20reported)) ([When Donald Comes to Town](https://jacobin.com/2016/08/trump-atlantic-city-casinos-taj-mahal-bankruptcy/#:~:text=By%20the%20time%20he%20announced,by%20Fred%20Trump%2C%20Donald%E2%80%99s%20father)).

## Alan “Ace” Greenberg (Investment Banker and Broker)  
- **Background**: Alan “Ace” Greenberg was the CEO of Bear Stearns, a prominent Wall Street investment bank, from 1978 through the 1980s. He was known for his shrewd trading acumen and a personal, hands-on approach to client service. Greenberg became one of Donald Trump’s close financial advisers on Wall Street. In fact, Trump considered Greenberg such a trusted confidant that he entrusted Greenberg with managing accounts for his children, a sign of deep trust ([Alan Greenberg: Financier who built up the Bear Stearns empire but who was partly blamed for the global financial crisis | The Independent | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/obituaries/alan-greenberg-financier-who-built-up-the-bear-stearns-empire-but-who-was-partly-blamed-for-the-global-financial-crisis-9636391.html#:~:text=Greenberg%2C%20whose%20clients%20included%20the,how%20much%20I%20trust%20him)) ([Alan Greenberg: Financier who built up the Bear Stearns empire but who was partly blamed for the global financial crisis | The Independent | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/obituaries/alan-greenberg-financier-who-built-up-the-bear-stearns-empire-but-who-was-partly-blamed-for-the-global-financial-crisis-9636391.html#:~:text=simple%20stock,how%20much%20I%20trust%20him)). Under Greenberg’s leadership, Bear Stearns was willing to work with Trump at times when other banks were cautious.

- **Role in Trump’s Financial Dealings**: Greenberg played a key role as **Trump’s stockbroker and facilitator for complex deals**. In 1986, Trump launched an **attempted takeover of Bally Manufacturing**, a rival casino operator, by quietly accumulating stock – a classic “greenmail” strategy. Ace Greenberg helped Trump amass a 9.6% stake in Bally Entertainment Corp during this covert raid ([Alan Greenberg: Financier who built up the Bear Stearns empire but who was partly blamed for the global financial crisis | The Independent | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/obituaries/alan-greenberg-financier-who-built-up-the-bear-stearns-empire-but-who-was-partly-blamed-for-the-global-financial-crisis-9636391.html#:~:text=A%20reputation%20for%20discretion%20made,of%20the%20rival%20casino%20operator)). Though Trump’s takeover attempt ultimately did not succeed (he withdrew and likely sold the shares for a profit), it demonstrated how Greenberg’s discretion and Wall Street savvy enabled Trump to make bold moves ([Alan Greenberg: Financier who built up the Bear Stearns empire but who was partly blamed for the global financial crisis | The Independent | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/obituaries/alan-greenberg-financier-who-built-up-the-bear-stearns-empire-but-who-was-partly-blamed-for-the-global-financial-crisis-9636391.html#:~:text=A%20reputation%20for%20discretion%20made,of%20the%20rival%20casino%20operator)). Greenberg’s Bear Stearns also underwrote bond offerings and provided financing for Trump’s projects in the 1980s when other firms were hesitant. For example, Bear Stearns was involved in financing Trump Tower and other early deals when Trump was a young, unproven developer – largely due to Greenberg’s personal rapport with Trump (originally cultivated through Trump’s father, Fred) ([Fred Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Trump#:~:text=Staten%20Island%20.,know%2C%20being%20the%20son%20of)) ([Fred Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Trump#:~:text=myself.)).

- **Relationship and Later Years**: The relationship between Trump and Greenberg was long-lasting; Greenberg remained an advisor into the 1990s and beyond. Greenberg’s willingness to back Trump (or find buyers for Trump’s debt and stock) helped sustain Trump’s expansion. In Greenberg’s later years, he recounted Trump as a valued client, though Bear Stearns itself collapsed in 2008 (after Greenberg’s tenure) in the financial crisis. Ace Greenberg died in 2014. Publicly, Trump has spoken fondly of Greenberg – reflecting on how Bear Stearns stood by him during tough times. Outside of Trump, Greenberg was connected to other famous financiers (like Henry Kravis and Irwin Jacobs) for whom he quietly accumulated shares in target companies ([Alan Greenberg: Financier who built up the Bear Stearns empire but who was partly blamed for the global financial crisis | The Independent | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/obituaries/alan-greenberg-financier-who-built-up-the-bear-stearns-empire-but-who-was-partly-blamed-for-the-global-financial-crisis-9636391.html#:~:text=A%20reputation%20for%20discretion%20made,of%20the%20rival%20casino%20operator)). His **“reputation for discretion”** was exactly what attracted Trump ([Alan Greenberg: Financier who built up the Bear Stearns empire but who was partly blamed for the global financial crisis | The Independent | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/obituaries/alan-greenberg-financier-who-built-up-the-bear-stearns-empire-but-who-was-partly-blamed-for-the-global-financial-crisis-9636391.html#:~:text=Greenberg%2C%20whose%20clients%20included%20the,how%20much%20I%20trust%20him)). In summary, during 1986–89, Ace Greenberg was a key behind-the-scenes enabler of Trump’s financial strategies – from stock plays to securing capital – and exemplified the close ties Trump cultivated with loyal financiers ([Alan Greenberg: Financier who built up the Bear Stearns empire but who was partly blamed for the global financial crisis | The Independent | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/obituaries/alan-greenberg-financier-who-built-up-the-bear-stearns-empire-but-who-was-partly-blamed-for-the-global-financial-crisis-9636391.html#:~:text=A%20reputation%20for%20discretion%20made,of%20the%20rival%20casino%20operator)).

## Michael “Mike” Rose (Casino Partner – Holiday Inn/Harrah’s)  
- **Background**: Mike Rose was the CEO of Holiday Corporation (the parent of Holiday Inn hotels) in the 1980s. Under his leadership, Holiday Inn expanded into the casino business by acquiring Harrah’s. In the early 1980s, Atlantic City’s casino boom attracted Rose’s interest. **In 1982, Rose approached Donald Trump** with a proposal: Holiday Inn/Harrah’s would fund and build a casino hotel on the Atlantic City Boardwalk if Trump would manage the construction ([Trump Entertainment Resorts - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Entertainment_Resorts#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%20began%20purchasing%20properties,2)). This led to a joint venture that became **Harrah’s at Trump Plaza**, Trump’s first casino, which opened in 1984.

- **Role in Trump’s Atlantic City Entry**: Mike Rose and Holiday Inn provided the capital and casino expertise Trump initially lacked. They essentially bankrolled the construction of Trump Plaza. Trump contributed the prime Boardwalk land (which he had secured option on) and his name/vision, while Holiday Inn’s Harrah’s division handled the operations and financing risk. This partnership was critical to Trump’s entry into gambling: Trump received a New Jersey casino license in March 1982 and gained credibility by teaming with an established hotel brand ([Trump Entertainment Resorts - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Entertainment_Resorts#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%20began%20purchasing%20properties,2)). However, the partnership was short-lived. By 1986, Trump bought out Holiday’s interest in the property for roughly $220 million and dropped the Harrah’s name ([Trump Entertainment Resorts - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Entertainment_Resorts#:~:text=Control%20Commission%20%20,2)) ([Trump Entertainment Resorts - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Entertainment_Resorts#:~:text=CEO%20of%20Holiday%20Inn%20,2)). Rose’s company exited after New Jersey regulators found Trump suitable to take full control.

- **Relationship and Outcome**: The relationship between Trump and Rose was professional. While not publicly acrimonious, Trump was eager to own properties outright and proved quick to end partnerships once he learned the ropes. After Holiday Inn left the Plaza venture, Mike Rose continued to lead Holiday Corporation (which later spun off its casino arm as Promus Companies). For Trump, the end of the partnership meant assuming large debt but also full share of profits. Rose’s contribution was pivotal – he essentially **mentored Trump into the casino industry** and provided the financing when Trump had limited resources. This set the stage for Trump’s later independent casino projects. The Holiday Inn–Trump Plaza deal is often seen as a win-win that turned into a solo Trump enterprise. In hindsight, it showed Trump’s pattern of using partnerships to launch projects, then consolidating ownership. Mike Rose is remembered in Trump’s 1986–89 story as the established executive who gave Trump’s fledgling casino career a boost and then departed once Trump took the training wheels off ([Trump Entertainment Resorts - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Entertainment_Resorts#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%20began%20purchasing%20properties,2)) ([Trump Entertainment Resorts - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Entertainment_Resorts#:~:text=CEO%20of%20Holiday%20Inn%20,2)).

## Nicholas Ribis (Trump’s Casino Attorney and Executive)  
- **Background**: Nicholas L. Ribis is a New Jersey attorney who became one of Donald Trump’s closest advisers in Atlantic City. Ribis began working with Trump in the early 1980s as Trump’s **main casino lawyer**, representing Trump’s interests before New Jersey regulators and in casino partnerships ([Nicholas Ribis - RAGEPATH Wiki](https://wiki.ragepath.org/Nicholas_Ribis#:~:text=Nicholas%20Ribis%20,three%20Atlantic%20City%20casinos)). By the late ’80s, Ribis was known as Trump’s right-hand man in Atlantic City, often appearing at Casino Control Commission hearings on Trump’s behalf. He had a deep knowledge of gaming law and was adept at negotiating with state officials.

- **Role in Trump’s Financial Dealings**: In the 1986–1989 period, Ribis’s role was primarily as a **legal strategist and behind-the-scenes deal-maker** for Trump’s casino empire. He helped navigate the complex regulatory approvals for Trump’s acquisitions (such as the Trump Castle purchase in 1985 and the Taj Mahal licensing in 1988–89). Ribis was instrumental in securing New Jersey Casino Control Commission approval for Trump’s projects, including arguing Trump’s case when concerns arose about financing (for example, helping to persuade regulators to green-light the Taj Mahal project despite its unconventional junk bond funding) ([When Donald Comes to Town](https://jacobin.com/2016/08/trump-atlantic-city-casinos-taj-mahal-bankruptcy/#:~:text=In%201988%2C%20Trump%20convinced%20a,%E2%80%9D)). Within the Trump Organization, Ribis’s influence grew; he was involved in major business decisions and contract negotiations with contractors, unions, and partners. His loyalty and effectiveness earned Trump’s trust to an extraordinary degree.

- **Elevation and Later Changes**: In **January 1991, Trump appointed Nick Ribis CEO of all three Atlantic City casinos**, formalizing Ribis’s authority ([Nicholas Ribis - RAGEPATH Wiki](https://wiki.ragepath.org/Nicholas_Ribis#:~:text=,Beach%20Post%2C%20January%2024%2C%201991)). This move came just after the 1986–89 boom period, as Trump was struggling with casino debts. It underscores that by the end of the 1980s, Ribis had become the top executive in Trump’s casino operations. Ribis continued to run Trump’s casinos (later as president of Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts) throughout the 1990s. The partnership eventually ended in 2000 when Ribis resigned amid corporate restructurings ([No More Mister Nice Blog: REMEMBER WHEN TRUMP DID THOSE THINGS THAT WERE FUTILE, WHILE FAILING? THIS IS KINDA LIKE THAT.](https://nomoremister.blogspot.com/2017/06/remember-when-trump-did-those-things.html#:~:text=sudden%20departure%20of%20The%20Donald%E2%80%99s,was%20leaving%2C%20Trump%20fired%20him)). After leaving Trump’s company, Ribis even attempted to launch a rival casino venture backed by new investors ([PAYBACK TIME FOR TRUMP? – EX-PALS ARE AIMING TO EAT ...](https://nypost.com/2000/10/05/payback-time-for-trump-ex-pals-are-aiming-to-eat-his-taj-mahals-lunch/#:~:text=PAYBACK%20TIME%20FOR%20TRUMP%3F%20%E2%80%93,heading%20up%20an%20effort)). Their relationship was largely professional and amicable until the end; Trump and Ribis worked together for about 25 years ([No More Mister Nice Blog: REMEMBER WHEN TRUMP DID THOSE THINGS THAT WERE FUTILE, WHILE FAILING? THIS IS KINDA LIKE THAT.](https://nomoremister.blogspot.com/2017/06/remember-when-trump-did-those-things.html#:~:text=,was%20leaving%2C%20Trump%20fired%20him)). Ribis’s involvement beyond Trump included various gaming ventures and legal practice. In Trump’s late-’80s narrative, Nick Ribis stands out as the **key behind-the-scenes lawyer** who safeguarded Trump’s casino interests and later took the reins as a top executive to steer the troubled casino division through a turbulent era ([Nicholas Ribis - RAGEPATH Wiki](https://wiki.ragepath.org/Nicholas_Ribis#:~:text=,Beach%20Post%2C%20January%2024%2C%201991)).

## Stephen F. Hyde (Trump Casino CEO)  
- **Background**: Stephen F. Hyde was a veteran casino executive whom Trump recruited to bring professional management to his growing Atlantic City holdings. Hyde had started as a CPA and entered the gaming industry in Las Vegas in 1971 ([FUNERAL IN KAYSVILLE MONDAY FOR TRUMP CEO KILLED IN ...](https://www.deseret.com/1989/10/15/18828075/funeral-in-kaysville-monday-for-trump-ceo-killed-in-crash/#:~:text=FUNERAL%20IN%20KAYSVILLE%20MONDAY%20FOR,chief%20executive%20officer%20of)). By the 1980s, he had a reputation as one of the “savviest gaming executives” in the country ([Quote by Michael Kranish: “TRUMP EVENTUALLY REALIZED THAT he needed execut...”](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7865886-trump-eventually-realized-that-he-needed-executives-with-a-strong#:~:text=in%20running%20casinos,a%20business%20potentially%20worth%20billions)). Notably, Hyde worked for Steve Wynn (Trump’s rival) at the Golden Nugget casino, meaning he was well-versed in high-end casino operations ([Quote by Michael Kranish: “TRUMP EVENTUALLY REALIZED THAT he needed execut...”](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7865886-trump-eventually-realized-that-he-needed-executives-with-a-strong#:~:text=gambling%2C%20but%20the%20casino%20industry,%E2%80%9D%20Trump)). A devout Mormon, Hyde fit an industry pattern of hiring Mormons in key roles for their perceived honesty and steady temperament ([Quote by Michael Kranish: “TRUMP EVENTUALLY REALIZED THAT he needed execut...”](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7865886-trump-eventually-realized-that-he-needed-executives-with-a-strong#:~:text=in%20running%20casinos,a%20business%20potentially%20worth%20billions)).

- **Role in Trump’s Operations**: Trump hired Hyde around 1986 to lead his casino businesses, which by then included Trump Plaza and Trump’s Castle and soon the Taj Mahal. As **CEO of Trump’s casino operations**, Hyde became one of Trump’s most trusted associates ([Quote by Michael Kranish: “TRUMP EVENTUALLY REALIZED THAT he needed execut...”](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7865886-trump-eventually-realized-that-he-needed-executives-with-a-strong#:~:text=was%20soft,That%20meant%20some%20other%20senior)). He had overall responsibility for profitability and management at the casinos ([TRUMP TAJ MAHAL, ASSOC. v. Costruzioni Aeronautiche Giovanni ...](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/761/1143/1683972/#:~:text=TRUMP%20TAJ%20MAHAL%2C%20ASSOC,that%20capacity%20had%20overall)). Colleagues described Hyde as soft-spoken and unflappable ([Quote by Michael Kranish: “TRUMP EVENTUALLY REALIZED THAT he needed execut...”](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7865886-trump-eventually-realized-that-he-needed-executives-with-a-strong#:~:text=gambling%2C%20but%20the%20casino%20industry,%E2%80%9D%20Trump)), providing a contrast to Trump’s more brash style. Trump publicly praised Hyde’s “sense of how to manage to the bottom line” and acknowledged that Hyde’s expertise was critical to running a multi-casino empire ([Quote by Michael Kranish: “TRUMP EVENTUALLY REALIZED THAT he needed execut...”](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7865886-trump-eventually-realized-that-he-needed-executives-with-a-strong#:~:text=Wynn,their%20concerns%20to%20Trump%20without)). Hyde often acted as a buffer between Trump and other executives, taking charge of day-to-day decisions. Under Hyde’s stewardship in the late ’80s, Trump’s casinos expanded marketing efforts, hosted major boxing matches, and prepared for the Taj Mahal’s launch. Hyde was instrumental in coordinating the April 1990 opening of the Taj Mahal, at that time the largest casino in the world.

- **Tragic End and Impact**: On October 10, 1989, Stephen Hyde was **killed in a helicopter crash**, along with two other top Trump executives, while returning from a press conference ([Trump Entertainment Resorts - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Entertainment_Resorts#:~:text=The%20company%20was%20shaken%20by,7)). His death was a major blow to Trump’s organization. Trump lost his top casino manager on the eve of his biggest casino opening. Hyde’s absence was felt in the financial unraveling that followed – some observers believe that had Hyde lived, he might have managed the Taj Mahal’s finances better to avoid its quick bankruptcy. Trump himself was shaken, as Hyde had been at “the top of that chain of command” in Atlantic City ([Quote by Michael Kranish: “TRUMP EVENTUALLY REALIZED THAT he needed execut...”](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7865886-trump-eventually-realized-that-he-needed-executives-with-a-strong#:~:text=but%20most%20of%20all%2C%20he,Hyde%E2%80%9D)). After Hyde’s death, Trump had to scramble to fill the leadership gap (eventually promoting Nick Ribis as noted). Beyond Trump’s world, Hyde is remembered as a highly respected casino executive. In Atlantic City lore, he’s credited with instilling more disciplined management in Trump’s operations during a freewheeling expansion era. His tenure (1986–1989) coincided with Trump’s peak casino growth – a period of risky overexpansion that Hyde tried to keep on track. Sadly, his career was cut short at age 43. Trump later reflected on Hyde with admiration, and Hyde’s legacy lived on in the many casino managers he mentored.

## Mark Grossinger Etess (President of Trump Plaza/Taj Mahal)  
- **Background**: Mark G. Etess came from a legendary hospitality family – his relatives ran Grossinger’s, a famous Catskills resort. Etess graduated from Cornell’s Hotel School in 1975 ([Rachel Etess Green '98 - Cornell School of Hotel Administration](https://sha.cornell.edu/people/rachel-etess-green/#:~:text=Rachel%20Etess%20Green%20%2798%20,known)), positioning him for a career in hotel and casino management. By the late 1980s, Etess had become **President and COO of Trump Plaza** in Atlantic City ([Trump Entertainment Resorts - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Entertainment_Resorts#:~:text=The%20men%20were%20Steven%20F,Taj%20Mahal%2C%20and%20Trump)). Young (mid-30s) and energetic, he was known for creative marketing and was a rising star in Trump’s organization. Trump selected Etess to also take on the role of President of the upcoming Taj Mahal, signaling great confidence in him.

- **Role in Trump’s Dealings**: As Trump’s casino portfolio grew, Etess was often the operational face of the business. He managed Trump Plaza – the flagship Boardwalk casino – and helped turn it into a popular venue for high-rollers and boxing events. Trump valued Etess’s lineage in hospitality and his showmanship in promoting Trump casinos. For example, Etess oversaw glitzy events and entertainment bookings that drew crowds (the Trump Plaza even had a sports arena briefly named after him posthumously ([Hard Rock Live (Atlantic City, New Jersey) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Rock_Live_(Atlantic_City,_New_Jersey)#:~:text=Hard%20Rock%20Live%20,an%20October%201989%20helicopter%20crash))). In 1989, Etess was focusing on the final stages of preparing the **Taj Mahal for its grand opening**, coordinating everything from staffing to casino floor layout. His dual role meant he was central to Trump’s strategy of cross-promoting events between his properties. Etess’s family background gave him a deep understanding of resort customers, which benefited Trump’s attempts to create an extravagant experience at the Taj.

- **Fate and Legacy**: Mark Etess tragically **died in the same October 10, 1989 helicopter crash** that killed Stephen Hyde ([Trump Entertainment Resorts - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Entertainment_Resorts#:~:text=The%20company%20was%20shaken%20by,7)). He was just 37. His death, alongside Hyde’s, removed two key executives at a critical juncture. The New Jersey casino community honored Etess by naming the new Hard Rock casino arena (formerly the Taj arena) the “Mark G. Etess Arena” ([Hard Rock Live (Atlantic City, New Jersey) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Rock_Live_(Atlantic_City,_New_Jersey)#:~:text=Hard%20Rock%20Live%20,an%20October%201989%20helicopter%20crash)), a tribute to his impact. Within Trump’s company, Etess’s loss meant Trump had to find new leadership for the Taj right as it opened. Etess did not live to see the Taj’s highly anticipated April 1990 opening, but his groundwork helped complete it. Aftermath: Etess’s family continued in hospitality (his daughter went into hotel administration ([Rachel Etess Green '98 - Cornell School of Hotel Administration](https://sha.cornell.edu/people/rachel-etess-green/#:~:text=Rachel%20Etess%20Green%20%2798%20,known))). For Trump, Etess’s passing was a personal and professional blow – he lost a trusted young executive whom he reportedly viewed almost like family. Etess’s name remains associated with the grandeur and ultimate fragility of Trump’s late-’80s casino ambitions.

## Jonathan Benanav (Trump Plaza Executive VP)  
- **Background and Role**: Jonathan Benanav was an Executive Vice President at Trump Plaza in the late 1980s ([Trump Entertainment Resorts - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Entertainment_Resorts#:~:text=The%20company%20was%20shaken%20by,7)). Less publicly known than Hyde or Etess, Benanav was nonetheless a key member of Trump’s Atlantic City management team. He likely had a background in finance or casino administration and was tasked with high-level duties at Trump Plaza, such as overseeing financial operations or marketing initiatives under Mark Etess’s presidency.

- **In Trump’s Orbit**: Benanav’s inclusion among Trump’s top brass is most evident by the fact that he accompanied Hyde and Etess on the fateful helicopter trip in October 1989. This suggests he was deeply involved in the promotion and planning for Trump’s casinos (they were returning from a press event for a big boxing match) ([Trump Entertainment Resorts - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Entertainment_Resorts#:~:text=The%20company%20was%20shaken%20by,7)). His role can be seen as that of a **senior operations executive**, ensuring that Trump Plaza – and by extension Trump’s casino network – ran smoothly and coordinated major events. While detailed public information on Benanav is scarce, he was part of Trump’s inner circle of casino confidants and contributed to strategic decisions during the 1986–89 expansion (for example, likely working on cross-casino customer programs or high-stakes player development).

- **Outcome**: Jonathan Benanav also **perished in the October 10, 1989 helicopter crash** alongside Hyde and Etess ([Trump Entertainment Resorts - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Entertainment_Resorts#:~:text=The%20company%20was%20shaken%20by,7)). He was in his 30s. The simultaneous loss of Benanav, Hyde, and Etess was described by Trump as “devastating” for the company, wiping out much of the senior leadership in Atlantic City in one stroke. In the aftermath, Trump had to restructure and bring in new managers. While Benanav’s name is not as commonly recalled in media, within the Trump Organization he is remembered as part of the trio of top executives who died serving Trump’s interests. His death underscored the turbulence in Trump’s casino journey – not only financial swings but human losses. Colleagues described all three men as talented and dedicated; New Jersey regulators even cited the crash as a serious setback in their 1991 assessment of Trump’s casinos ([The 5 People Who Could Have Stopped Trump - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/11/01/the-five-people-who-could-have-stopped-trump-229894#:~:text=What%20the%20casino%20commissioners%E2%80%94Perskie%20and,tier)). Benanav’s story is a reminder of the often overlooked individuals behind Trump’s enterprises whose steady work kept the business functioning during its most aggressive growth years.

## Steven P. Perskie (New Jersey Casino Regulator)  
- **Background**: Steven Perskie is a New Jersey lawyer, judge, and politician who was instrumental in the state’s casino industry oversight. As a young assemblyman, Perskie **authored the 1977 New Jersey Casino Control Act**, which established the legal framework for Atlantic City gambling ([Onus On Government, Not Casinos, To Make Sure New Jersey ...](https://www.vixio.com/insights/gc-onus-government-not-casinos-make-sure-new-jersey-gaming-works#:~:text=Onus%20On%20Government%2C%20Not%20Casinos%2C,old%20New%20Jersey%20assemblyman)) ([Onus On Government, Not Casinos, To Make Sure New Jersey ...](https://www.vixio.com/insights/gc-onus-government-not-casinos-make-sure-new-jersey-gaming-works#:~:text=%E2%80%9CState%20and%20city%20officials%20never,old%20New%20Jersey%20assemblyman)). By the late 1980s, Perskie’s career had evolved; he left the bench in 1989 to become Governor Jim Florio’s Chief of Staff ([Steven P. Perskie - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_P._Perskie#:~:text=Perskie%20was%20appointed%20an%20Atlantic,Staff%20from%201989%20to%201990)), and in 1990 Florio appointed Perskie as **Chairman of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission (CCC)** ([Steven P. Perskie - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_P._Perskie#:~:text=Perskie%20was%20appointed%20as%20Chairman,In%202001%2C%20Perskie%20was)). Perskie was thus a chief regulator at the exact time Trump’s casino empire was facing scrutiny and financial strain.

- **Role in Trump’s Dealings**: Perskie had a dual influence on Trump’s fortunes. First, as the “architect” of NJ casino law, Perskie helped create the environment in which Trump operated ([The 5 People Who Could Have Stopped Trump - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/11/01/the-five-people-who-could-have-stopped-trump-229894#:~:text=Image%3A%20A%20photograph%20of%20Steve,Perskie)). The Act he wrote mandated strict licensing standards and financial stability requirements to protect the public interest. Second, as CCC Chairman starting in 1990 (and as a leading regulatory figure in 1988–89 behind the scenes), Perskie directly oversaw licensing hearings for Trump’s properties. In 1988, when Trump was seeking approval to take over the Taj Mahal project, Perskie and other regulators were initially **skeptical of Trump’s heavy debt financing**. Trump assured the commission he’d use reputable bank financing, not junk bonds ([When Donald Comes to Town](https://jacobin.com/2016/08/trump-atlantic-city-casinos-taj-mahal-bankruptcy/#:~:text=In%201988%2C%20Trump%20convinced%20a,%E2%80%9D)). Perskie later lamented that the CCC was “conned” by these promises as Trump immediately issued junk bonds after getting the license ([When Donald Comes to Town](https://jacobin.com/2016/08/trump-atlantic-city-casinos-taj-mahal-bankruptcy/#:~:text=In%201988%2C%20Trump%20convinced%20a,%E2%80%9D)). By 1991, Perskie famously led hearings to determine if Trump’s casinos (Taj Mahal, Trump Plaza, Trump Castle) were financially stable enough to remain licensed given Trump’s debt problems ([The 5 People Who Could Have Stopped Trump - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/11/01/the-five-people-who-could-have-stopped-trump-229894#:~:text=In%20the%20spring%20and%20summer,an%20end%20to%20Donald%20Trump)) ([The 5 People Who Could Have Stopped Trump - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/11/01/the-five-people-who-could-have-stopped-trump-229894#:~:text=sagged%20in%20the%20throes%20of,to%20Atlantic%20City%E2%80%99s%20wheezing%20economy)). Perskie was tough but cautious – rather than revoke Trump’s licenses, he imposed tighter monitoring and reporting requirements on Trump’s casinos ([The 5 People Who Could Have Stopped Trump - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/11/01/the-five-people-who-could-have-stopped-trump-229894#:~:text=of%20Congress%2C%20in%20particular%20Republicans%E2%80%94there,And%20didn%E2%80%99t)) ([The 5 People Who Could Have Stopped Trump - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/11/01/the-five-people-who-could-have-stopped-trump-229894#:~:text=What%20the%20casino%20commissioners%E2%80%94Perskie%20and,tier)). He stated for the record that Trump’s “financial viability…is in serious peril” in 1991 ([The 5 People Who Could Have Stopped Trump - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/11/01/the-five-people-who-could-have-stopped-trump-229894#:~:text=continue,to%20Atlantic%20City%E2%80%99s%20wheezing%20economy)).

- **Nature of Relationship and Legacy**: Perskie was not personally allied with Trump; if anything, he was a gatekeeper whom Trump had to persuade. Insiders note Perskie was aware of Atlantic City’s dependence on Trump’s casinos for jobs and tax revenue, which made the regulatory decisions delicate ([The 5 People Who Could Have Stopped Trump - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/11/01/the-five-people-who-could-have-stopped-trump-229894#:~:text=brand%20boost%20of%20The%20Art,Trump%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Cfinancial%20viability%2C%E2%80%9D%20Steven%20P)) ([The 5 People Who Could Have Stopped Trump - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/11/01/the-five-people-who-could-have-stopped-trump-229894#:~:text=sagged%20in%20the%20throes%20of,to%20Atlantic%20City%E2%80%99s%20wheezing%20economy)). Perskie later defended the decision to give Trump a chance to recover, saying it was about protecting the public interest, not saving Trump per se ([The 5 People Who Could Have Stopped Trump - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/11/01/the-five-people-who-could-have-stopped-trump-229894#:~:text=match%20at%20L120%20which%20was,Perskie%20told%20me%20this%20week)) ([The 5 People Who Could Have Stopped Trump - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/11/01/the-five-people-who-could-have-stopped-trump-229894#:~:text=which%20was%20to%20pull%20the,Perskie%20told%20me%20this%20week)). Over time, Perskie expressed **regret** at what happened afterward (Trump’s multiple bankruptcies) but maintained that the commission’s call was reasonable at the time ([The 5 People Who Could Have Stopped Trump - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/11/01/the-five-people-who-could-have-stopped-trump-229894#:~:text=This%20week%2C%20Perskie%20and%20I,%E2%80%9D)). Perskie left the CCC in 1994, later returning to private law and even being inducted into the Gaming Hall of Fame for his regulatory contributions ([Steven P. Perskie - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_P._Perskie#:~:text=mediation%20%2F%20arbitration%20practice.,)). In Trump’s 1986–89 narrative, Perskie represents the **regulatory force** that both enabled and restrained Trump: he enabled Trump by crafting laws that let casinos thrive and by approving his projects, but also placed limits meant to hold Trump accountable. Their interactions underscore the tension between Trump’s high-leverage business tactics and the state’s mandate to ensure casino owners’ stability and integrity ([The 5 People Who Could Have Stopped Trump - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/11/01/the-five-people-who-could-have-stopped-trump-229894#:~:text=sagged%20in%20the%20throes%20of,to%20Atlantic%20City%E2%80%99s%20wheezing%20economy)) ([The 5 People Who Could Have Stopped Trump - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/11/01/the-five-people-who-could-have-stopped-trump-229894#:~:text=Perskie%2C%20the%20chairman%20of%20the,to%20Atlantic%20City%E2%80%99s%20wheezing%20economy)).

## Edward I. Koch (New York City Mayor)  
- **Background**: Ed Koch was the Mayor of New York City from 1978 to 1989. A brash, outspoken Democrat, Koch presided over the city’s financial recovery and development boom in the 1980s. During this era, Donald Trump rose as a prominent Manhattan real estate developer, which inevitably put him in frequent contact – and conflict – with City Hall. Koch and Trump had a famously combative relationship that often played out in the press.

- **Clashes over Business and Development**: Trump needed city approvals, tax abatements, and zoning changes for his projects, and Koch was not always accommodating. They **sparred over several issues**: Trump’s request for a tax abatement on Trump Tower was one early friction point ([Donald Trump's feud with former New York mayor Edward Koch reignites - despite the city chief being dead | The Independent | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-edward-koch-new-york-mayor-real-estate-millionaire-democrat-us-president-a7605541.html#:~:text=after%20Mr%20Koch%20failed%20in,a%20fourth%20term%20as%20mayor)) ([Donald Trump's feud with former New York mayor Edward Koch reignites - despite the city chief being dead | The Independent | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-edward-koch-new-york-mayor-real-estate-millionaire-democrat-us-president-a7605541.html#:~:text=The%20pair%20had%20repeatedly%20clashed,building%20in%20Manhattan%20and%20the)). Koch denied Trump a tax break he sought in the late ’70s, which set a tone of animosity. In the mid-’80s, Trump proposed ambitious projects like Television City (a massive West Side development including the world’s tallest tower) and running the city’s drab West Side Highway as a private toll road; Koch dismissed some of these ideas, publicly calling them too grandiose. Perhaps their most direct confrontation was over the refurbishment of the Wollman Rink in Central Park. The city had struggled for years to renovate the ice rink, and in 1986 Trump volunteered to take it over and finish it quickly. Trump did so under budget and faster than the city, which embarrassed Koch’s administration. While Koch credited Trump for the rink’s success, tensions remained. Trump, on his end, frequently criticized Koch’s governance, calling him “a very incompetent mayor” who presided over a corrupt administration ([Donald Trump's feud with former New York mayor Edward Koch reignites - despite the city chief being dead | The Independent | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-edward-koch-new-york-mayor-real-estate-millionaire-democrat-us-president-a7605541.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L211%20%E2%80%9CKoch%20has,%E2%80%9D)) ([Donald Trump's feud with former New York mayor Edward Koch reignites - despite the city chief being dead | The Independent | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-edward-koch-new-york-mayor-real-estate-millionaire-democrat-us-president-a7605541.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CKoch%20has%20achieved%20something%20quite,%E2%80%9D)). In 1986, when Trump was opening Trump Tower and expanding his hotel empire, Koch’s administration sometimes slow-walked approvals, which Trump loudly protested.

- **Personal Barbs and End of Era**: The feud often got personal. Trump labeled Koch “a loser” and “one of the worst mayor[s]” in New York’s history, accusing him of holding the city back ([Donald Trump's feud with former New York mayor Edward Koch reignites - despite the city chief being dead | The Independent | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-edward-koch-new-york-mayor-real-estate-millionaire-democrat-us-president-a7605541.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L211%20%E2%80%9CKoch%20has,%E2%80%9D)). Koch in return famously called Trump “greedy, greedy, greedy” during the late ’80s, painting Trump as a avaricious self-promoter ([Donald Trump's feud with former New York mayor Edward Koch reignites - despite the city chief being dead | The Independent | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-edward-koch-new-york-mayor-real-estate-millionaire-democrat-us-president-a7605541.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CKoch%20has%20achieved%20something%20quite,%E2%80%9D)). The animosity even extended to name-calling; Koch quipped that Trump’s epitaph should read “Here lies greedy, greedy, greedy” ([Donald Trump's feud with former New York mayor Edward Koch reignites - despite the city chief being dead | The Independent | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-edward-koch-new-york-mayor-real-estate-millionaire-democrat-us-president-a7605541.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CKoch%20has%20achieved%20something%20quite,%E2%80%9D)). Their relationship effectively ended when Koch left office in 1989 (after losing a primary for a fourth term). After Koch’s mayoralty, Trump actually mended fences with Koch’s successor, but Koch continued to speak ill of Trump in essays, finding it “incomprehensible” that some viewed Trump as a folk hero ([Donald Trump's feud with former New York mayor Edward Koch reignites - despite the city chief being dead | The Independent | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-edward-koch-new-york-mayor-real-estate-millionaire-democrat-us-president-a7605541.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L189%20The%20US,in%20December%202013%2C%20aged%2088)) ([Donald Trump's feud with former New York mayor Edward Koch reignites - despite the city chief being dead | The Independent | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-edward-koch-new-york-mayor-real-estate-millionaire-democrat-us-president-a7605541.html#:~:text=The%20US%20President%20clashed%20repeatedly,in%20December%202013%2C%20aged%2088)). The Koch-Trump dynamic is significant to Trump’s 1986–89 period because it exemplified Trump’s battles with government authority. It showed Trump’s strategy of going public with grievances to pressure officials, and Koch’s refusal to be bullied. Despite their clashes, Trump did achieve success in Koch’s New York (completing Trump Tower, buying the Plaza Hotel, etc.), but often in spite of City Hall. Koch, who died in 2013, remained a critic of Trump long after the 1980s, while Trump in recent years still recalled Koch with disdain. Their feud was an iconic subplot of New York in the ’80s – the brash developer and the equally brash mayor, constantly at odds ([Donald Trump's feud with former New York mayor Edward Koch reignites - despite the city chief being dead | The Independent | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-edward-koch-new-york-mayor-real-estate-millionaire-democrat-us-president-a7605541.html#:~:text=after%20Mr%20Koch%20failed%20in,a%20fourth%20term%20as%20mayor)) ([Donald Trump's feud with former New York mayor Edward Koch reignites - despite the city chief being dead | The Independent | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-edward-koch-new-york-mayor-real-estate-millionaire-democrat-us-president-a7605541.html#:~:text=Mr%20Koch%20responded%20by%20calling,Mr%20Trump%3A%20%E2%80%9CGreedy%2C%20greedy%2C%20greedy%E2%80%9D)).

Each of these individuals – whether partners, financiers, lawyers, regulators, or rivals – played a pivotal role in Donald Trump’s financial saga in the late 1980s. Their interactions with Trump reveal the complex web of support, conflict, and consequence that underpinned Trump’s real estate acquisitions, casino ventures, legal battles, and financial maneuvers during the era. The rise-and-fall stories of Trump’s projects in 1986–1989 cannot be told without these key figures, whose own careers were in many cases profoundly affected by their association with Trump ([Fred Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Trump#:~:text=In%201987%2C%20when%20Donald%27s%20loan,126)) ([Trump Entertainment Resorts - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Entertainment_Resorts#:~:text=In%201988%2C%20Trump%20purchased%20the,6)).
