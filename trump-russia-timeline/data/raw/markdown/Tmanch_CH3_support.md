# Chapter 3 – Key Individuals (1991–2000)

In the 1990s, Donald Trump’s faltering business empire was propped up by a cast of financiers, political operatives, and shadowy figures with international ties. Below is a forensic profile of each major individual mentioned in Chapter 3 of the DJT framework (covering 1991–2000), excluding Trump himself. These profiles detail their backgrounds, interactions with Trump, networks and influence, alternate interpretations of their roles, and their significance in the broader geopolitical puzzle.

## Financial Actors (Bankers, Oligarchs, Buyers, and Fixers)

### Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal (Saudi Billionaire Investor)  
**Background & Context:** Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal Al Saud is a Saudi businessman and member of the royal family renowned as one of the world’s richest investors. Often called the “richest Arab,” he amassed a global portfolio in hotels, banking, and media ([The globe's richest Arab - and the man who runs a big slice of the world | ITV News](https://www.itv.com/news/2013-01-22/prince-al-waleed-bin-talal-the-worlds-richest-arab-the-man-who-runs-a-big-slice-of-the-world#:~:text=Prince%20Al,household%20names%20the%20world%20over)). During the 1990s, his wealth and influence in global markets were immense.  

**Trump Ties:** Al-Waleed twice swooped in to relieve Trump’s financial distress. In 1991, as Trump teetered on personal bankruptcy, Al-Waleed purchased Trump’s 282-foot yacht, the **Trump Princess** (formerly the *Nabila*, which had belonged to arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi), providing desperately needed cash ([Trump’s Conflicts of Interest in Saudi Arabia - Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/trumps-conflicts-interest-saudi-arabia/#:~:text=purchased%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20yacht%2C%20Trump%20Princess%2C,highlighted%20how%20he%20twice%20bailed)) ([Adnan Khashoggi: the 'whoremonger' whose arms deals funded a playboy life of decadence and 'pleasure wives' | The Independent | The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/adnan-khashoggi-dead-saudi-arms-dealer-playboy-pleasure-wives-billionaire-lifestyle-wealth-profit-from-arms-sales-war-death-wealth-sex-superyacht-super-rich-iran-contra-iraq-alyamamah-thatcher-conspiracy-a7778031.html#:~:text=Image%3A%20Arms%20deals%20brought%20Adnan,personal%20bodyguard%20nicknamed%20Mr%20Kill)). A few years later, in 1995, Al-Waleed led a rescue of the **Plaza Hotel** in New York. Trump’s lenders forced a sale, and Al-Waleed’s consortium bought the Plaza for $325 million – a price $65 million less than what Trump had paid years earlier ([Trump’s Conflicts of Interest in Saudi Arabia - Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/trumps-conflicts-interest-saudi-arabia/#:~:text=purchased%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20yacht%2C%20Trump%20Princess%2C,highlighted%20how%20he%20twice%20bailed)). By bailing out Trump’s prized assets, Al-Waleed effectively became a lifeline for Trump during his 1990s debt crisis. Trump and Al-Waleed later acknowledged these dealings in public spats – with the Prince reminding Trump how he “bailed him out twice” ([Trump’s Conflicts of Interest in Saudi Arabia - Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/trumps-conflicts-interest-saudi-arabia/#:~:text=according%20to%20Newsweek,owner%20of%20Fox%20News)).  

**Network & Connections:** Al-Waleed’s investment network spans Western banks and properties. In the Plaza deal, he partnered with Singapore magnate Kwek Leng Beng, marking the hotel’s first foreign ownership ([The Plaza Deal - 60 Years of Global Trust - cdl.com.sg](https://www.cdl.com.sg/60years/ourstories/the-plaza-deal.html#:~:text=owner%20Donald%20J%20Trump%20faced,to%20make%20it%20more)) ([Hi Life!](https://hi-life.hongleong.com.sg/September2019/getting-to-know-you-article01.html#:~:text=Left%20photo%3A%20In%201995%2C%20Hong,since%20its%20opening%20in%201907)). Globally, Al-Waleed cultivated relationships with political leaders and business elites (even Britain’s Prince Charles), leveraging his wealth for influence ([The globe's richest Arab - and the man who runs a big slice of the world | ITV News](https://www.itv.com/news/2013-01-22/prince-al-waleed-bin-talal-the-worlds-richest-arab-the-man-who-runs-a-big-slice-of-the-world#:~:text=Prince%20Al,household%20names%20the%20world%20over)) ([The globe's richest Arab - and the man who runs a big slice of the world | ITV News](https://www.itv.com/news/2013-01-22/prince-al-waleed-bin-talal-the-worlds-richest-arab-the-man-who-runs-a-big-slice-of-the-world#:~:text=Throughout%20the%20Prince%E2%80%99s%20suite%20of,present%20that%20you%20can%20imagine)). His buyouts of distressed Western assets like Trump’s were part of a broader pattern of Middle Eastern petrodollar investment in the 1990s.  

**Influence Analysis:** Financially, Al-Waleed’s infusions kept Trump’s empire afloat. While there’s no indication these purchases were meant to curry political favor at the time, they did give a foreign investor significant leverage over Trump’s prized holdings. Al-Waleed’s deals with Trump foreshadow how vulnerable Trump’s businesses were to foreign capital **and** how such capital could potentially be a channel of influence. However, Al-Waleed appears to have been motivated by investment value – e.g. scooping up trophy assets at bargain prices – rather than any covert agenda ([Trump’s Conflicts of Interest in Saudi Arabia - Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/trumps-conflicts-interest-saudi-arabia/#:~:text=purchased%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20yacht%2C%20Trump%20Princess%2C,highlighted%20how%20he%20twice%20bailed)). Notably, by the mid-2010s their relationship soured publicly, suggesting no enduring alliance.  

**Alternative Explanations:** It’s plausible to view Al-Waleed’s actions as opportunistic business moves. Trump’s yacht and hotel were distress sales; Al-Waleed, a savvy investor, pounced on the chance to acquire luxury assets cheaply. In this interpretation, Trump was simply a businessman on the losing end of hard-nosed deals, with Al-Waleed acting as a pragmatic creditor rather than a political “handler.” The later Twitter feuds between the two support the idea that their transactions were transactional, not part of a long-term influence plan ([Trump’s Conflicts of Interest in Saudi Arabia - Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/trumps-conflicts-interest-saudi-arabia/#:~:text=according%20to%20Newsweek,owner%20of%20Fox%20News)).  

**Conclusion & Significance:** Prince Al-Waleed’s role in the 1990s illustrates how foreign money propped up Trump at critical moments. This underscores a theme of **financial vulnerability** – Trump’s dependence on overseas financiers to survive. While Al-Waleed did not exert overt political influence, his bailouts set a precedent for Trump’s reliance on foreign capital, a factor with implications when evaluating potential leverage over Trump in later years. His involvement also shows the intermingling of high finance and politics on the global stage: a Saudi prince rescuing a future American president’s business is an episode loaded with geopolitical symbolism. ([Trump’s Conflicts of Interest in Saudi Arabia - Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/trumps-conflicts-interest-saudi-arabia/#:~:text=purchased%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20yacht%2C%20Trump%20Princess%2C,highlighted%20how%20he%20twice%20bailed))

### Adnan Khashoggi (Saudi Arms Dealer & Tycoon)  
**Background & Context:** Adnan Khashoggi was an infamous Saudi arms broker and billionaire playboy. In the 1980s he was considered among the world’s richest men, known for giant arms deals and an opulent lifestyle that earned him the nickname “The Great Gatsby of the Middle East” ([Adnan Khashoggi - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adnan_Khashoggi#:~:text=Adnan%20Khashoggi%20,4)). By the early 1990s, Khashoggi’s star had faded somewhat – he became entangled in the BCCI scandal and was prosecuted (and acquitted) in 1990 alongside Imelda Marcos for fraud. Nonetheless, he remained emblematic of the shadowy nexus of wealth, politics, and illicit trade.  

**Trump Ties:** Trump’s most direct link to Khashoggi was through the yacht *Nabila*. This 86-meter superyacht, one of the largest in the world, was Khashoggi’s floating palace. In 1987, amid Khashoggi’s financial troubles, Trump purchased the yacht for a reported $29 million, renaming it the Trump Princess ([Adnan Khashoggi: the 'whoremonger' whose arms deals funded a playboy life of decadence and 'pleasure wives' | The Independent | The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/adnan-khashoggi-dead-saudi-arms-dealer-playboy-pleasure-wives-billionaire-lifestyle-wealth-profit-from-arms-sales-war-death-wealth-sex-superyacht-super-rich-iran-contra-iraq-alyamamah-thatcher-conspiracy-a7778031.html#:~:text=Image%3A%20Arms%20deals%20brought%20Adnan,personal%20bodyguard%20nicknamed%20Mr%20Kill)). Trump later had to surrender this yacht to creditors in 1991, after which it was bought by Prince Al-Waleed ([Trump’s Conflicts of Interest in Saudi Arabia - Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/trumps-conflicts-interest-saudi-arabia/#:~:text=purchased%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20yacht%2C%20Trump%20Princess%2C,highlighted%20how%20he%20twice%20bailed)). Thus, Khashoggi’s extravagant asset became a prop in Trump’s saga of boom and bust. There are also indirect ties: Khashoggi’s international dealings (e.g. with Gulf elites and even figures in the Iran-Contra affair) put him in the same orbit as many power players that Trump courted. However, beyond the yacht sale and social mingling, there’s no evidence of Khashoggi and Trump partnering in any arms or business venture.  

**Network & Connections:** Khashoggi’s network was vast and spanned continents. He brokered arms deals between the U.S., Saudi Arabia, and other countries, rubbing shoulders with CIA figures, royals, and politicians. He was related by marriage to the Al-Fayed family of Egypt (his sister married billionaire Mohamed Al-Fayed) and was uncle to Dodi Fayed ([Adnan Khashoggi - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adnan_Khashoggi#:~:text=)). His connections to the Marcos family, Sultan of Brunei, and various covert networks were well known. In Trump’s context, Khashoggi represented the glitzy international high society that Trump aspired to join – a world of private jets and mega-yachts. It’s telling that Trump coveted and bought Khashoggi’s yacht; owning it was a status symbol linking him to Khashoggi’s elite circle.  

**Influence Analysis:** As a financial actor, Khashoggi indirectly influenced Trump by offloading luxury assets that Trump desired. The *Nabila* purchase can be seen as Trump trying to emulate Khashoggi’s billionaire lifestyle at a time when his own finances were shaky. There is also a symbolic influence: Khashoggi’s persona – lavish, daring, controversial – may have been something Trump admired. However, there is no indication Khashoggi attempted to sway Trump politically. If anything, Trump was one of many buyers Khashoggi dealt with when liquidating assets. Any deeper “influence” would be the example Khashoggi set: that one could live large on borrowed money and international intrigue – a template Trump in some ways followed in the 1980s and ’90s.  

**Alternative Explanations:** The Trump-Khashoggi link is likely just business (Trump bought a used yacht) and social posturing. Trump has long been drawn to celebrity and power; Khashoggi was a global celebrity of a sort. Acquiring Khashoggi’s yacht could have been Trump’s way of inserting himself into that narrative of glamour and international intrigue, rather than Khashoggi picking Trump for any scheme. In fact, by the 1990s, Khashoggi was struggling; he wasn’t in a position to manipulate major U.S. figures even if he wanted to. Trump may simply have been one of the last big-ticket customers in Khashoggi’s rolodex.  

**Conclusion & Implications:** Adnan Khashoggi’s presence in Trump’s story underscores how Trump, even in the ’90s, orbited an **international cast of oligarchs and fixers**. It highlights Trump’s comfort in dealing with figures who had notoriety for illegal or unethical dealings. While Khashoggi himself likely did not exert influence on Trump, the fact that Trump’s yacht and other assets trace back to such actors is significant. It shows how **early foreign entanglements** (even if just via assets) became woven into Trump’s business. This set the stage for later decades when Russian and other post-Soviet oligarchs would play similar roles in Trump’s real estate ventures. Khashoggi’s yacht – once host to arms deal negotiations and wild parties – literally became part of the Trump empire, a metaphor for the intermingling of Trump’s finances with global clandestine wealth ([Adnan Khashoggi: the 'whoremonger' whose arms deals funded a playboy life of decadence and 'pleasure wives' | The Independent | The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/adnan-khashoggi-dead-saudi-arms-dealer-playboy-pleasure-wives-billionaire-lifestyle-wealth-profit-from-arms-sales-war-death-wealth-sex-superyacht-super-rich-iran-contra-iraq-alyamamah-thatcher-conspiracy-a7778031.html#:~:text=Image%3A%20Arms%20deals%20brought%20Adnan,personal%20bodyguard%20nicknamed%20Mr%20Kill)).

### Wilbur Ross (Banker and Later U.S. Commerce Secretary)  
**Background & Context:** Wilbur Ross is an American financier who made a fortune in distressed assets and later served as Trump’s Commerce Secretary. In the early 1990s, Ross was a top banker at Rothschild Inc., specializing in bankruptcy and restructuring. He earned the moniker “King of Bankruptcy” for orchestrating deals to save failing companies. Ross’s path first crossed with Trump during one such corporate rescue. By the end of the 1990s, Ross also became involved in U.S.-Russia investment initiatives (as a Clinton-era appointee on the U.S.-Russia Investment Fund) ([Donald Trump's Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and his Russian business ties - ICIJ](https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/donald-trumps-commerce-secretary-wilbur-ross-and-his-russian-business-ties/#:~:text=much%20an%20asset,assist%20for%20the%20future%20president)), foreshadowing his later connections to Russian business (e.g. Bank of Cyprus).  

**Trump Ties:** Wilbur Ross played a pivotal role in 1990–91 when Trump’s **Taj Mahal casino** in Atlantic City went bankrupt. Ross represented a group of bondholders who were owed $675 million by Trump ([Donald Trump's Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and his Russian business ties - ICIJ](https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/donald-trumps-commerce-secretary-wilbur-ross-and-his-russian-business-ties/#:~:text=late%201970s%2C%20he%20joined%20the,assist%20for%20the%20future%20president)). Rather than push for Trump’s ouster, Ross engineered a restructuring that kept Trump on as a stakeholder and figurehead. He reportedly argued to skeptical creditors that the “Trump” name was still an asset worth preserving ([Donald Trump's Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and his Russian business ties - ICIJ](https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/donald-trumps-commerce-secretary-wilbur-ross-and-his-russian-business-ties/#:~:text=Trump%20in%201990%20when%20the,assist%20for%20the%20future%20president)). This deal allowed Trump to avoid total ruin – he gave up 50% ownership of the Taj but retained a role, salvaging his image ([Donald Trump's Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and his Russian business ties - ICIJ](https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/donald-trumps-commerce-secretary-wilbur-ross-and-his-russian-business-ties/#:~:text=Trump%20in%201990%20when%20the,assist%20for%20the%20future%20president)). Essentially, Ross threw Trump a lifeline, convincing investors to take a haircut on the debt in exchange for Trump staying in charge (and presumably helping the casino’s brand). This “welcome assist” ([Donald Trump's Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and his Russian business ties - ICIJ](https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/donald-trumps-commerce-secretary-wilbur-ross-and-his-russian-business-ties/#:~:text=Trump%20in%201990%20when%20the,assist%20for%20the%20future%20president)) from Ross kept Trump’s casino empire alive a little longer. Ross and Trump stayed friendly; Ross bought a home near Trump’s Florida Mar-a-Lago club and would later be an early supporter of Trump’s presidential run. By 2014, Ross also became vice-chairman of the Bank of Cyprus – a bank notorious for Russian money flows – which would become relevant in analyses of Trump’s Russia ties (though that was after our 1990s timeframe).  

**Network & Connections:** In the 90s, Ross was deeply connected on Wall Street and had government ties. He was a Yale and Harvard graduate and moved in elite financial circles. His involvement with the U.S.-Russia Investment Fund (a government-backed fund to invest in post-Soviet Russia) in the mid-90s put him in contact with Russian business interests and U.S. officials managing Russian economic transition ([Donald Trump's Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and his Russian business ties - ICIJ](https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/donald-trumps-commerce-secretary-wilbur-ross-and-his-russian-business-ties/#:~:text=much%20an%20asset,assist%20for%20the%20future%20president)). Ross’s actions with Trump’s Taj Mahal connected him to Trump’s circle (including fellow creditor-turned-friend Carl Icahn in later deals). Ross’s willingness to align with Trump in 1990 – against some bondholders’ wishes – suggests he recognized the value of Trump’s celebrity brand. It forged a bond between the two men. By keeping Trump in place, Ross also kept open a channel to Atlantic City’s political and business scene, which included numerous organized-crime-connected figures frequenting the casinos (though Ross himself was not involved with them).  

**Influence Analysis:** Ross’s intervention had a significant influence on Trump’s financial survival. He essentially **shielded Trump from the full consequences of bankruptcy** ([Donald Trump's Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and his Russian business ties - ICIJ](https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/donald-trumps-commerce-secretary-wilbur-ross-and-his-russian-business-ties/#:~:text=Trump%20in%201990%20when%20the,assist%20for%20the%20future%20president)). The deal Ross structured can be seen as a strategic move to harness Trump’s name recognition for creditors’ long-term benefit – but it also meant Trump’s fortunes were being guided by a Wall Street insider with broader interests. In terms of geopolitical influence, Ross’s later Russian business ties raise eyebrows. While in the 90s Ross was simply doing his job as a banker, the fact that a figure who saved Trump’s casino later ended up intertwined with Russian oligarchs (Ross partnered with Russian-connected investors at Bank of Cyprus by 2014) suggests a potential **convergence of networks**. It invites the question of whether Ross’s early support of Trump made Trump more palatable to other financiers with Eastern European ties down the line. However, nothing indicates Ross acted in the 90s on anyone’s behalf but the bondholders’. His priority then was recouping investment, not geopolitics.  

**Alternative Explanations:** Ross’s role can be viewed as purely business-minded. Trump’s Taj Mahal, despite its troubles, had brand value and a chance to rebound under Trump’s showmanship. Ross likely calculated that keeping Trump’s name on the casino would maximize recovery for creditors, compared to ousting him. Indeed, he told investors that Trump’s name was “still very much an asset” ([Donald Trump's Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and his Russian business ties - ICIJ](https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/donald-trumps-commerce-secretary-wilbur-ross-and-his-russian-business-ties/#:~:text=Trump%20in%201990%20when%20the,assist%20for%20the%20future%20president)). In this light, Ross was not trying to help Trump out of friendship or influence – he was making a cold calculation that happened to also benefit Trump. The subsequent friendly relationship between them could simply be gratitude and mutual self-interest (Trump knew Ross helped save him; Ross knew Trump’s survival could lead to future deals). At the time, Ross’s involvement with Russia was limited to an official investment fund role, suggesting no ulterior Russian angle in the Taj Mahal deal.  

**Conclusion & Significance:** Wilbur Ross in the 1990s exemplifies the kind of **Wall Street “fixer”** who enabled Trump’s rise by restructuring his massive debts. Ross’s deal to keep Trump in business was crucial: without it, Trump might have lost his casino empire entirely and with it much of his platform for future ventures ([Donald Trump's Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and his Russian business ties - ICIJ](https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/donald-trumps-commerce-secretary-wilbur-ross-and-his-russian-business-ties/#:~:text=Trump%20in%201990%20when%20the,assist%20for%20the%20future%20president)). This episode also planted a seed of a long-term alliance – decades later, Ross would join Trump’s Cabinet. In the context of foreign influence, Ross’s story is a reminder that **financial dependence on powerful figures** can open doors to wider networks. Ross’s later connections to Russian finance (though beyond the 90s) mean that the man who saved Trump financially was, in the end, one degree of separation from Kremlin-linked oligarchs. That convergence is striking and underlines why Ross is a key figure to scrutinize when mapping Trump’s ties. His actions were arguably benign in intent (creditor negotiations), but they had the effect of keeping Trump in the game – a game that would increasingly involve foreign money as years went on ([Donald Trump's Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and his Russian business ties - ICIJ](https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/donald-trumps-commerce-secretary-wilbur-ross-and-his-russian-business-ties/#:~:text=Trump%20in%201990%20when%20the,assist%20for%20the%20future%20president)) ([Salon: Trump’s deep links to organized crime: Federal investigators know and the public is catching on | Congressman Mike Quigley](https://quigley.house.gov/media-center/news-article/salon-trump-s-deep-links-organized-crime-federal-investigators-know-and#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20David%20Bogatin%3A%20In,reportedly%20personally%20sold%20to%20him)).

### Semyon “Sam” Kislin (Ukrainian-American Commodities Trader)  
**Background & Context:** Semyon “Sam” Kislin is a Ukrainian-born businessman who emigrated to the U.S. and made a fortune in New York electronics and commodities trading. In the 1970s and ’80s, Kislin co-owned an electronics store in Manhattan (Joy-Lud) that was frequented by Soviet officials, through which he developed contacts in the USSR. By the 1990s, Kislin had become a wealthy trader in metals and raw commodities, doing extensive business with post-Soviet states. He was also a notable political donor in New York City, especially to Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Kislin’s name has surfaced in law-enforcement investigations: by the late ’90s, the FBI reportedly suspected him of ties to Russian organized crime (specifically associates of mob boss Vyacheslav Ivankov), though Kislin has denied wrongdoing ([FBI tracked alleged Russian mob ties of Giuliani campaign supporter](https://publicintegrity.org/politics/elections/fbi-tracked-alleged-russian-mob-ties-of-giuliani-campaign-supporter/#:~:text=FBI%20tracked%20alleged%20Russian%20mob,%E2%80%A6)).  

**Trump Ties:** Sam Kislin intersected with Trump’s world primarily through real estate financing. In 1998, as Trump began selling luxury condos at the newly built **Trump World Tower** (a skyscraper by the U.N.), Kislin’s firm *Trans Commodities* provided millions of dollars in **mortgages to Russian buyers** of those units ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=Trump%20begins%20selling%20units%20in,By)) ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=states%20www,York%20City%20real%20estate%20developer)). This was highly unusual – Kislin was effectively facilitating an influx of Russian money into Trump’s project by giving loans to wealthy individuals from the former USSR to purchase Trump condos ([A novel trump of Russia — the tower full of oligarchs](https://intmassmedia.com/2017/03/17/a-novel-trump-of-russia-the-tower-full-of-oligarchs/#:~:text=A%20novel%20trump%20of%20Russia,trump%20tower%20was%20the)). This occurred in the wake of the 1998 Russian financial collapse, when Russian millionaires were desperate to move capital to safe havens like U.S. real estate ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=institutions%20willing%20www,scheduled%20to%20open%20in%202001)) ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=market%20collapses,of%20Trump%20World%20Tower%20involve)). Kislin’s financing help meant more condo sales (and cash) for Trump. Kislin was also **an early business acquaintance of Trump**: back in the late 1970s, Trump had bought about 200 television sets on credit from Kislin’s electronics store for one of his first big projects ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=states%20www,York%20City%20real%20estate%20developer)). Kislin later boasted that Trump repaid that debt on time ([Gangster Party candidate: Trump’s ties to Russian organized crime](https://theins.ru/en/politics/98190#:~:text=Gangster%20Party%20candidate%3A%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20ties,time%2C%20in%201996%20and%201997)). Additionally, Kislin donated to Trump’s friend Rudy Giuliani and even served on a NYC economic council Giuliani created in 1996, indicating he had political clout ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=sold%20200%20television%20sets%20to,York%20City%20real%20estate%20developer)). In sum, Kislin helped funnel post-Soviet money into Trump properties and had longstanding ties to Trump dating back to Trump’s early career ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=states%20www,York%20City%20real%20estate%20developer)).  

**Network & Connections:** Kislin’s network bridged New York and the former Soviet Union. His partner in the electronics business was Temur Sapir (later known as Tamir Sapir), who also became a billionaire (and another Trump associate, profiled below) ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=states%20www,York%20City%20real%20estate%20developer)). Kislin cultivated relationships with Soviet/Russian officials through business, and with American politicians through donations. Notably, FBI and Organized Crime Task Force reports linked Kislin to mob figures: for example, a 1996 Interpol report alleged Kislin had laundered money for Russian syndicates, and law enforcement tied him to Vyacheslav Ivankov’s circle ([FBI tracked alleged Russian mob ties of Giuliani campaign supporter](https://publicintegrity.org/politics/elections/fbi-tracked-alleged-russian-mob-ties-of-giuliani-campaign-supporter/#:~:text=FBI%20tracked%20alleged%20Russian%20mob,%E2%80%A6)). Kislin was never charged in those cases, but such reports show he was on the radar of intelligence agencies. By financing Trump condo buyers, Kislin connected Trump to a network of oligarchs and rich ex-Soviets seeking haven in the West. One could say Kislin acted as a **conduit** between Eastern money and Western assets. He also intersected with Giuliani’s network – hosting fundraisers for Giuliani and donating to other politicians ([Giuliani Donor Linked to Russian Mob - The Moscow Times](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/1999/12/22/giuliani-donor-linked-to-russian-mob-a64300#:~:text=Giuliani%20Donor%20Linked%20to%20Russian,1%20million%20for)) ([Gangster Party candidate: Trump’s ties to Russian organized crime](https://theins.ru/en/politics/98190#:~:text=In%20an%20interview%20Sam%20Kislin,time%2C%20in%201996%20and%201997)). This gave him local influence, which may explain how he became an approved lender for high-profile properties like Trump’s.  

**Influence Analysis:** Kislin’s role raises potential red flags in terms of **money laundering and influence**. By providing mortgages to foreign buyers in Trump World Tower, Kislin enabled a large amount of Russian capital to flow into Trump’s hands. Bloomberg reported that by 2004, up to one-third of apartments on certain floors of Trump World Tower were owned by people or LLCs connected to Russia or neighboring states ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=Trump%20begins%20selling%20units%20in,By)) ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=units%20sold%20on%20the%2076,in%201996%20%2029%20appoints)). Kislin was instrumental in that trend ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=Trump%20begins%20selling%20units%20in,By)). The influence question is: were those purchases purely legitimate investments, or part of moving ill-gotten gains abroad? U.S. experts note that buying luxury real estate via shell companies is a common laundering technique, and Kislin’s background suggests he was familiar with such capital flight ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=institutions%20willing%20www,scheduled%20to%20open%20in%202001)). Kislin’s assistance certainly benefited Trump financially – boosting sales at a critical time. If any of Kislin’s clients or backers had political motives (e.g. ingratiating themselves with Trump), Kislin would have been the facilitator. It’s also notable that Kislin had a foot in New York politics; one of Trump’s key political allies (Giuliani) accepted Kislin despite FBI concerns ([FBI tracked alleged Russian mob ties of Giuliani campaign supporter](https://publicintegrity.org/politics/elections/fbi-tracked-alleged-russian-mob-ties-of-giuliani-campaign-supporter/#:~:text=FBI%20tracked%20alleged%20Russian%20mob,%E2%80%A6)). This suggests Kislin was able to navigate and possibly **influence political circles** while advancing Russian business interests. However, from another angle, Kislin may have simply been making profitable loans, with no intent beyond business.  

**Alternative Explanations:** It’s possible to view Sam Kislin’s Trump dealings as straightforward commerce. After Russia’s 1998 crash, many Russians legitimately sought to invest their money in New York real estate as a safe haven ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=institutions%20willing%20www,scheduled%20to%20open%20in%202001)). Kislin, fluent in both worlds, was well positioned to serve these clients – and Trump World Tower was a premier new address. His loans might have been nothing more than a businessman seizing an opportunity: earning interest by helping wealthy Russians buy condos they wanted. Under this view, Kislin wasn’t trying to influence Trump – he was trying to make money *alongside* Trump. Trump benefited by selling units, Kislin benefited by collecting mortgage payments. As for mob allegations, Kislin has strongly denied them and was never indicted; his supporters say he’s a respectable entrepreneur. The coincidence that he knew Trump from the 70s and reappeared in the 90s as a lender could simply reflect the tight-knit nature of New York’s business community of immigrant strivers.  

**Conclusion & Significance:** Sam Kislin is a critical figure illustrating the pipeline of **post-Soviet money into Trump’s ventures**. His actions in the 90s helped sustain Trump’s real estate ambitions when domestic banks were wary of Trump. Kislin’s story also highlights the overlap of politics and business: even as law enforcement eyed him, he sat on a city economic board and interacted with figures like Trump and Giuliani ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=sold%20200%20television%20sets%20to,York%20City%20real%20estate%20developer)). For the DJT framework’s purposes, Kislin’s profile shows how **foreign funds and actors gained a foothold in Trump’s projects well before he entered politics**. It also underscores a risk: by relying on operators like Kislin, Trump’s enterprise became intertwined with networks that possibly included organized crime and foreign influence. This would merit further investigation, as later chapters likely explore if those early financial ties translated into political vulnerabilities. In any case, Kislin’s facilitation of Russian purchases at Trump World Tower stands as a concrete example of East-West mingling in Trump’s 90s business ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=Trump%20begins%20selling%20units%20in,By)) ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=states%20www,York%20City%20real%20estate%20developer)).

### Tamir Sapir (aka Temur Sapir – Soviet-Émigré Real Estate Tycoon)  
**Background & Context:** Tamir Sapir was a Georgian-born (former USSR) immigrant who, like his one-time partner Sam Kislin, built a fortune in New York. Sapir (born Temur Sepiashvili) arrived in the U.S. in the 1970s and initially drove a taxi. Teaming up with Kislin in the electronics import business, he capitalized on Soviet officials’ appetite for American goods. In the 1990s, Sapir parlayed the wealth from trading fertilizer and oil (with ex-Soviet states) into New York real estate holdings. By the late ’90s he had quietly become a billionaire, buying trophy properties like Manhattan’s Duke Semans Mansion. Sapir kept a low profile but had deep connections in the Russian business world – he did extensive dealings in Russia and the Caucasus during the chaotic post-Soviet privatization era.  

**Trump Ties:** Tamir Sapir’s most significant interaction with Trump actually came just after 2000 – in 2006, Sapir partnered with Trump and Bayrock Group to develop the Trump SoHo hotel/condo in Manhattan. However, Sapir’s relationship with Trump was seeded in the 1990s. As mentioned, Sapir co-owned Joy-Lud electronics with Sam Kislin, and through Kislin was acquainted with Trump since the 1980s ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=states%20www,York%20City%20real%20estate%20developer)). Sapir’s daughter Zina even reportedly dined with Trump in the ’90s as a friendly acquaintance. The real nexus was the **Bayrock Group** connection: Bayrock (a development firm run by Soviet émigrés, see Felix Sater and Tevfik Arif profiles) was courting Trump around 2002, and Sapir – with his now substantial real estate funds – joined them. While the full Sapir-Trump business collaboration materialized in the 2000s, the **Chapter 3 timeframe (1991–2000)** likely references Sapir as part of the network of Soviet-born businessmen around Trump. Sapir’s wealth and willingness to invest in high-end real estate would have been known to Trump by the end of the ’90s. Notably, Sapir won a **“Businessman of the Year” award** at a 2007 Trump-hosted gala – Trump personally handed Sapir a trophy, reflecting their close ties ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=%2A%202002%3A%20Russian,is%20%2031%20the%20Sapir)). (This award was from an organization linked to Trump’s circle, underscoring Sapir’s insider status). In summary, Sapir became one of the ex-Soviet oligarchs in Trump’s orbit, eventually funneling tens of millions into Trump-branded projects.  

**Network & Connections:** Sapir was very connected in the post-Soviet elite. He dealt with Russian oil enterprises and government officials in the 90s and was said to have a relationship with Eduard Shevardnadze (former Soviet foreign minister and Georgian president). Through Bayrock, Sapir worked alongside **Felix Sater** and **Tevfik Arif**, who had their own web of ties to Russian and Central Asian oligarchs. Sapir’s Sapir Organization (his family real estate firm) and Bayrock became formally linked with Trump in the Trump SoHo project – bringing together Trump’s brand, Bayrock’s development skills, and Sapir’s capital ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=%2A%202002%3A%20Russian,Organization%2C%20founded%20by%20Tamir%20Sapir)). Sapir’s money notably had questionable origins: much was cash from Soviet commodity trades, a sector rife with mob influence (indeed, one of Sapir’s business partners in the 90s, Igor Malyar, was later convicted of a mob-related gasoline scam). Sapir’s social network included powerful NYC figures too; he donated to charities and political causes, though not as publicly as Kislin. Essentially, Sapir was a **bridge between Russian wealth and U.S. real estate**, very much like Kislin, but operating with even larger sums as an investor by the 2000s.  

**Influence Analysis:** During the 1990s, Sapir’s direct influence on Trump was more potential than kinetic – he was a rising rich guy in Trump’s extended circle. The significance lies in Sapir being **exactly the kind of foreign-sourced money** that could sustain Trump’s real estate ventures when conventional financing was hard to obtain. When Trump partnered with Bayrock (and Sapir) in the 2000s, it was a continuation of a trend begun in the 90s: tapping into ex-Soviet capital. If we examine Sapir’s role through an influence lens, one could argue that Sapir (wittingly or not) further entangled Trump with post-Soviet interests. Sapir’s massive wealth came from markets often controlled or infiltrated by organized crime groups and oligarchic clans in Russia. By accepting Sapir as a partner, Trump was, in effect, accepting money that likely had flowed out of the former USSR under murky circumstances. This opened Trump up to **financial dependency on oligarchic funds**. However, one must also consider that Sapir by then was an American citizen and legitimate developer; to Trump, he may have simply appeared as another New York real estate mogul, not a foreign agent. There is no evidence Sapir tried to shape Trump’s political views. The influence was more subtle: Sapir’s involvement made Trump’s business increasingly reliant on that post-Soviet ecosystem, which could later be leveraged by others (e.g. if Russian state actors wanted to influence Trump, knowing his business partners’ backgrounds would be useful).  

**Alternative Explanations:** It’s plausible that Trump saw Sapir in the 90s and early 2000s as nothing more than a rich immigrant success story to team up with. New York real estate is cosmopolitan; developers frequently partner with foreign investors. Sapir’s and Trump’s interests aligned naturally: Trump needed cash and project partners, Sapir sought prestigious projects to invest his fortune in. Their relationship can be viewed as a straight business partnership devoid of politics. Indeed, Sapir never made political headlines himself – he wasn’t known for lobbying or ideological pursuits. If anything, Sapir might have been influenced by Trump, enjoying the latter’s celebrity and learning the art of public grandiosity (which Sapir generally avoided – he was media-shy). In essence, Sapir’s presence could be seen as coincidental: one of many wealthy people drawn into Trump’s ambit because there was money to be made.  

**Conclusion & Significance:** Tamir Sapir’s relevance to the DJT framework is as a **prototype of the post-Soviet oligarchs who became enmeshed in Trump’s business ventures**. While much of Sapir’s direct impact came in the 2000s, the foundations were laid in the 90s as he accumulated wealth and moved in Trump’s circles. Sapir demonstrates how, even in the 1991–2000 period, Trump’s business network was **globalizing in shady ways** – aligning with billionaires whose fortunes were tied to the chaotic former Soviet economy. This would have implications later if those relationships introduced Trump to even more controversial figures (which Bayrock did, via Felix Sater). In the geopolitical landscape, Sapir is a reminder that Russian or ex-Soviet influence on Trump did not necessarily come through official government channels – it often came through **ostensibly private businessmen** like Sapir, who carried with them the invisible baggage of their home country’s corruption. Sapir’s story thus is a key piece in understanding the foreign money flows sustaining Trump’s empire as it rebounded around the turn of the millennium ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=%2A%202002%3A%20Russian,Organization%2C%20founded%20by%20Tamir%20Sapir)) ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=Organization%20www,Tamir%20Sapir)).

### Semion Mogilevich (Russian Organized Crime Boss)  
**Background & Context:** Semion Mogilevich is a Ukrainian-born Russian mafia boss, often cited as one of the most powerful organized crime figures of the post-Soviet era. Nicknamed “The Brainy Don” for his business acumen (he holds an economics degree), Mogilevich built a criminal empire involved in arms trafficking, drug smuggling, prostitution, and massive financial fraud. By the mid-1990s, the FBI considered Mogilevich the “boss of bosses” of the Russian mafia, with a global reach ([Salon: Trump’s deep links to organized crime: Federal investigators know and the public is catching on | Congressman Mike Quigley](https://quigley.house.gov/media-center/news-article/salon-trump-s-deep-links-organized-crime-federal-investigators-know-and#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20David%20Bogatin%3A%20In,reportedly%20personally%20sold%20to%20him)) ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBoss%20of%20bosses%E2%80%9D%2C%20Semion%20Mogilevich,live%20openly%20in%20Moscow%20today)). He operated largely from Eastern Europe (Russia, Hungary) but laundered money worldwide, including through the U.S. His organization (sometimes called the Solntsevskaya-Bratva network) embedded itself in the newly capitalist Russian economy and forged ties with ex-KGB officials. Notably, Mogilevich was linked to a huge 1990s money-laundering scandal at the Bank of New York, through which an estimated $10 billion of Russian funds illicitly flowed to the West ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=The%20mob%20were%20believed%20to,the%20Bank%20of%20New%20York)). During 1991–2000, Mogilevich was consolidating power; in 1995, a classified FBI report already warned he had become a significant threat ([Meet Semion Mogilevich, The 'Most Powerful Mobster In The World'](https://allthatsinteresting.com/semion-mogilevich#:~:text=At%20the%20same%20time%2C%20he,and%20Elson%2C%20are%20known%20killers)).  

**Trump Ties:** There is no evidence that Trump and Mogilevich met in person. However, Mogilevich’s tentacles touched Trump’s world via intermediaries and transactions in the 1990s. **Trump properties attracted Mogilevich-affiliated individuals:** In the late 1980s, Mogilevich associate David Bogatin (a Russian mobster) had purchased five condos in Trump Tower for $6 million – a classic laundering technique ([Salon: Trump’s deep links to organized crime: Federal investigators know and the public is catching on | Congressman Mike Quigley](https://quigley.house.gov/media-center/news-article/salon-trump-s-deep-links-organized-crime-federal-investigators-know-and#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20David%20Bogatin%3A%20In,reportedly%20personally%20sold%20to%20him)). (Bogatin fled the U.S. after a 1980s conviction; by the 90s he was identified as a Mogilevich lieutenant). More directly, in the mid-90s, Mogilevich sent one of his top henchmen, **Vyacheslav “Yaponchik” Ivankov**, to New York to oversee operations. Ivankov lived in Trump Tower for a time in 1994–95 while on the run ([Salon: Trump’s deep links to organized crime: Federal investigators know and the public is catching on | Congressman Mike Quigley](https://quigley.house.gov/media-center/news-article/salon-trump-s-deep-links-organized-crime-federal-investigators-know-and#:~:text=reportedly%20personally%20sold%20to%20him)) ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=Prior%20to%20his%20arrest%2C%20the,evidence%20Trump%20knew%20him%20personally)). When the FBI finally arrested Ivankov in 1995, they found among his belongings the phone number for Trump Tower’s executive office – suggesting he or his associates had been in communication with someone there ([Salon: Trump’s deep links to organized crime: Federal investigators know and the public is catching on | Congressman Mike Quigley](https://quigley.house.gov/media-center/news-article/salon-trump-s-deep-links-organized-crime-federal-investigators-know-and#:~:text=named%20Semion%20Mogilevich,reportedly%20personally%20sold%20to%20him)). Investigative reports indicate Ivankov was likely using Trump Tower as a convenient base, not that Trump personally dealt with him. Nonetheless, these incidents mean Mogilevich’s operatives were literally inhabiting Trump’s buildings and possibly interacting with Trump Organization staff. Fast forward to 1998, another Mogilevich-connected scheme emerged: a $150 million stock fraud by a firm called YBM Magnex (run by Mogilevich’s cronies) was busted by the FBI ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=new%20Manhattan%20high,year%20sentence%20for%20the%20scheme)) ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=immigrants%20acting%20with%20Michael%20Franzese%2C,Added%20July%2017%2C%202017)). The FBI noted that **Jacob Bogatin**, David’s brother, was CEO of the sham company and indicted for the fraud – tying back to the same network that parked money in Trump Tower ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=new%20Manhattan%20high,year%20sentence%20for%20the%20scheme)). Thus, through money laundering in real estate and crime figures on premises, Mogilevich’s network intersected Trump’s domain throughout the 90s.  

**Network & Connections:** Mogilevich’s network in the U.S. during the 90s revolved around Brighton Beach (the Russian enclave in Brooklyn) and white-collar crimes in big cities. He leveraged **corrupt bankers (e.g., the Bank of New York case involved bankers like Lucy Edwards) and shell companies** to move illicit funds ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=The%20mob%20were%20believed%20to,the%20Bank%20of%20New%20York)). His top U.S. partner was Vyacheslav Ivankov until Ivankov’s imprisonment. Mogilevich was also connected with other Russian mob families active in North America, such as the Balagula organization before him. His influence extended to corrupt politicians and businessmen in Eastern Europe – for instance, he was rumored to have a stake in Ukraine’s natural gas schemes and to have cooperatives with oligarchs. In terms of linking to Trump’s broader network: Felix Sater (profiled later) – a Russian-American who worked with Trump – had a father, Mikael Sheferofsky, who was an underling of Mogilevich ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=Sater%20has%20an%20interesting%20history%3A,1998%20cooperation%20agreement%20with%20federal)). That family connection meant by the late 90s, a future Trump associate (Sater) had direct familial links to Mogilevich’s gang. Additionally, many wealthy Russians who invested in Trump real estate in the late 90s and early 2000s derived wealth from industries Mogilevich infiltrated (like metals and oil). Mogilevich himself largely stayed abroad (he lived openly in Moscow later), but his money and minions were active in New York. The FBI believed *any* high-end business dealing with influxes of cash from the former USSR in the 90s – luxury condos, casinos, etc. – was likely to see Mogilevich’s footprint. Trump’s enterprises fell squarely in that category ([Salon: Trump’s deep links to organized crime: Federal investigators know and the public is catching on | Congressman Mike Quigley](https://quigley.house.gov/media-center/news-article/salon-trump-s-deep-links-organized-crime-federal-investigators-know-and#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20David%20Bogatin%3A%20In,reportedly%20personally%20sold%20to%20him)) ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBoss%20of%20bosses%E2%80%9D%2C%20Semion%20Mogilevich,live%20openly%20in%20Moscow%20today)).  

**Influence Analysis:** Mogilevich exemplifies **covert influence through organized crime**. He probably had no interest in Trump’s politics (Trump wasn’t in politics then), but he had great interest in Trump’s assets as vehicles to wash dirty money. The presence of Mogilevich’s operatives buying Trump condos and possibly socializing or doing business in Trump Tower implies a form of influence: Trump’s businesses were arguably compromised by organized crime money ([Salon: Trump’s deep links to organized crime: Federal investigators know and the public is catching on | Congressman Mike Quigley](https://quigley.house.gov/media-center/news-article/salon-trump-s-deep-links-organized-crime-federal-investigators-know-and#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20David%20Bogatin%3A%20In,reportedly%20personally%20sold%20to%20him)) ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=Prior%20to%20his%20arrest%2C%20the,evidence%20Trump%20knew%20him%20personally)). This could create **leverage** – for example, if Mogilevich’s people were spending millions at Trump properties, Trump Organization staff might develop a don’t-ask-don’t-tell policy toward them. Law enforcement noted that in Atlantic City, Trump’s casinos were fined repeatedly in the 90s for lax money-laundry controls ([Donald Trump's deep connections to dirty Russian money: The trail leads ...](https://www.salon.com/2017/07/14/donald-trumps-deep-connections-to-dirty-russian-money-its-a-trail-that-leads-back-more-than-30-years/#:~:text=,his%20Atlantic%20City%20casinos)), which aligns with mob presence. While Trump himself may not have directed or condoned criminal activity, the fact that these criminals felt comfortable operating on his turf suggests an environment they found accommodating (whether through negligence or design). Mogilevich’s infiltration of the financial system was so extensive that by the late 90s, the CIA reportedly briefed U.S. officials on the risk of Russian mobsters (like him) gaining influence in Western economies. So, the **geopolitical significance** is that a top Russian mob boss effectively used Trump-branded assets as outposts for his operations in America. That foreshadows potential vulnerabilities – if Trump ever sought higher office (which he later did), those past dealings could be pressure points.  

**Alternative Explanations:** It’s important to note that Trump was hardly alone in unknowingly hosting mob money; Manhattan real estate in the 90s was awash with it. One could argue Trump Tower simply happened to be a prestigious address, so of course mobsters wanted to live or work there for status. Trump might have been oblivious. Indeed, Ivankov’s presence in Trump Tower came to light only when the FBI arrested him ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=Prior%20to%20his%20arrest%2C%20the,evidence%20Trump%20knew%20him%20personally)), and there’s *no evidence* Trump knew Ivankov personally (“no evidence Trump knew him,” as one account notes ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=floor%20of%20the%20Trump%20Plaza,evidence%20Trump%20knew%20him%20personally))). The phone numbers found could have been obtained by associates without Trump Org’s direct involvement. Trump might have been the **unwitting landlord** to these criminals. In this light, any influence Mogilevich had was indirect – limited to abusing Trump’s businesses for their own ends. Trump’s defenders would say he was a victim of their deception, not a collaborator. And indeed, many developers at the time failed to rigorously vet cash buyers from overseas. So, Mogilevich’s use of Trump properties might indicate more about law enforcement blind spots than Trump’s intent.  

**Conclusion & Significance:** Semion Mogilevich’s appearance in the Trump saga is a stark reminder that **transnational organized crime intersected with Trump’s business during the 90s**. His henchmen’s condo purchases and residency in Trump Tower show how Kremlin-linked mob networks gained footholds in the U.S. economy – even in the heart of Trump’s flagship building ([Salon: Trump’s deep links to organized crime: Federal investigators know and the public is catching on | Congressman Mike Quigley](https://quigley.house.gov/media-center/news-article/salon-trump-s-deep-links-organized-crime-federal-investigators-know-and#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20David%20Bogatin%3A%20In,reportedly%20personally%20sold%20to%20him)) ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=Prior%20to%20his%20arrest%2C%20the,evidence%20Trump%20knew%20him%20personally)). This set a precedent: well before allegations of Russian state influence, Russian *mob* influence was present around Trump. Mogilevich’s activities contributed to the flow of illicit Russian funds into Trump ventures (e.g. via Bogatin’s purchases and possibly others), effectively laundering money and shoring up Trump’s finances in the process ([Salon: Trump’s deep links to organized crime: Federal investigators know and the public is catching on | Congressman Mike Quigley](https://quigley.house.gov/media-center/news-article/salon-trump-s-deep-links-organized-crime-federal-investigators-know-and#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20David%20Bogatin%3A%20In,reportedly%20personally%20sold%20to%20him)). For the geopolitical landscape, Mogilevich’s case illustrates how closely entwined organized crime and post-Soviet oligarchy were – and how that mix touched Trump. It raises the question, explored in later chapters, of whether this made Trump more susceptible to Russian leverage down the line. In short, Mogilevich is a critical piece linking Trump’s 90s financial world to the broader story of Russian influence and corruption that would become central in the 2010s ([Salon: Trump’s deep links to organized crime: Federal investigators know and the public is catching on | Congressman Mike Quigley](https://quigley.house.gov/media-center/news-article/salon-trump-s-deep-links-organized-crime-federal-investigators-know-and#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20David%20Bogatin%3A%20In,reportedly%20personally%20sold%20to%20him)) ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBoss%20of%20bosses%E2%80%9D%2C%20Semion%20Mogilevich,live%20openly%20in%20Moscow%20today)).

### David Bogatin (Soviet Emigre Businessman & Mogilevich Associate)  
**Background & Context:** David Bogatin was a former Soviet Army pilot who immigrated to the U.S. in the 1970s and became involved in organized crime activities, particularly gasoline tax fraud and money laundering. By the early 1980s, Bogatin was a key figure in a major Russian/Eastern European mob ring operating out of New York. In 1984, while looking to park illicit proceeds, Bogatin set his sights on Trump Tower – an icon of luxury and anonymity. He made headlines by purchasing five condos in Trump Tower for a total of about $6 million ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=27%2C%202017%5D%20,According%20to)). At the time, this was seen as one of the first big influxes of Eastern Bloc money into U.S. real estate. Three years later, in 1987, Bogatin pleaded guilty to participating in a gasoline bootlegging scheme (defrauding the government of fuel taxes) that was tied to the Colombo crime family and Russian mobsters ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=their%20criminal%20enterprises,million%20stock%20scam%20and%20money)). Facing prison, he fled the country, leaving those Trump Tower condos in limbo. During the 1990s, Bogatin was on the run abroad (eventually resurfacing in Poland). In 1998, his brother Jacob Bogatin was indicted in the Mogilevich-linked $150 million stock fraud (YBM Magnex) – further cementing David Bogatin’s connection to Mogilevich’s crime family ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=immigrants%20acting%20with%20Michael%20Franzese%2C,Added%20July%2017%2C%202017)). U.S. investigators by the ’90s explicitly identified David Bogatin as a lieutenant of Semion Mogilevich ([Salon: Trump’s deep links to organized crime: Federal investigators know and the public is catching on | Congressman Mike Quigley](https://quigley.house.gov/media-center/news-article/salon-trump-s-deep-links-organized-crime-federal-investigators-know-and#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20David%20Bogatin%3A%20In,reportedly%20personally%20sold%20to%20him)).  

**Trump Ties:** Bogatin’s main link to Trump is through those Trump Tower condo purchases. In 1984, Donald Trump personally attended the closing when Bogatin bought the units – reportedly Trump himself signed off on the sale ([Salon: Trump’s deep links to organized crime: Federal investigators know and the public is catching on | Congressman Mike Quigley](https://quigley.house.gov/media-center/news-article/salon-trump-s-deep-links-organized-crime-federal-investigators-know-and#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20David%20Bogatin%3A%20In,reportedly%20personally%20sold%20to%20him)). At the time, Trump was eager to sell condos to foreign buyers at high prices, and Bogatin’s $6 million deal was significant. Unbeknownst to Trump (presumably), this was dirty money being washed. In 1987, when Bogatin was convicted, authorities seized his five Trump Tower condos as assets bought with criminal proceeds ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=new%20Manhattan%20high,year%20sentence%20for%20the%20scheme)). This incident connected Trump Tower to mob money in official records. In the 1990s, while Bogatin was a fugitive, those condos were liquidated by law enforcement – so Trump Org might not have had further direct dealings with him then. However, the story didn’t end there. Bogatin’s family and associates remained around. Notably, as mentioned, **Jacob Bogatin** (David’s brother) ran a front company for Mogilevich in the late ’90s ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=immigrants%20acting%20with%20Michael%20Franzese%2C,Added%20July%2017%2C%202017)). When Jacob was indicted in 2003, it again highlighted that the same network which had stashed money in Trump Tower in ’84 was active through the ’90s. Thus, Trump’s business was entangled as an unwitting repository for the Bogatin/Mogilevich mob cash. It’s also worth noting that these early sales set a pattern: by Trump’s own admission, he loved selling condos to rich Russians. Donald Trump Jr. later quipped that Russian buyers were a disproportionate part of their clientele ([Salon: Trump’s deep links to organized crime: Federal investigators know and the public is catching on | Congressman Mike Quigley](https://quigley.house.gov/media-center/news-article/salon-trump-s-deep-links-organized-crime-federal-investigators-know-and#:~:text=a%20pretty%20disproportionate%20cross,money%20pouring%20in%20from%20Russia)) – David Bogatin was arguably the archetype of that trend.  

**Network & Connections:** David Bogatin’s network was essentially Mogilevich’s network. In the U.S., he worked with the **Balagula gang** (another Russian mob group) and dealt with Italian-American mobsters like Michael Franzese (Colombo family) in the gas tax scams ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=guilty%20to%20a%20money%20laundering,year%20sentence%20for%20the%20scheme)). In Eastern Europe, after fleeing, Bogatin reportedly became involved in banking in Poland and had relationships extending to Moscow. FBI memos from the 1990s show David Bogatin on a list of Mogilevich operatives and detail his ties to the crime syndicate known as the Solntsevskaya Bratva ([Meet Semion Mogilevich, The 'Most Powerful Mobster In The World'](https://allthatsinteresting.com/semion-mogilevich#:~:text=At%20the%20same%20time%2C%20he,and%20Elson%2C%20are%20known%20killers)). Essentially, Bogatin acted as a financial facilitator, moving money into assets like U.S. real estate. Within Trump’s orbit, Bogatin’s network overlapped with other shady buyers: for example, another early Trump Tower buyer in the 80s was Vyacheslav Ivankov’s associate – indicating a cluster of Russian mob-affiliated owners in Trump properties. It’s likely they knew each other or at least were aware that Trump Tower was friendly turf. Bogatin’s case was so notorious that it’s specifically cited in multiple chronicles of Trump-Russia connections as the opening salvo of Russian money entering Trump’s real estate ([Salon: Trump’s deep links to organized crime: Federal investigators know and the public is catching on | Congressman Mike Quigley](https://quigley.house.gov/media-center/news-article/salon-trump-s-deep-links-organized-crime-federal-investigators-know-and#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20David%20Bogatin%3A%20In,reportedly%20personally%20sold%20to%20him)).  

**Influence Analysis:** Bogatin’s purchases benefited Trump financially in the short term, but in the long term they brought law enforcement scrutiny and, arguably, made Trump Tower a magnet for more dubious cash. The influence here is through **financial entanglement**. Once Trump sold those condos to Bogatin, he had, perhaps unknowingly, accepted laundered funds. This set up a dynamic: other Mogilevich-tied individuals (seeing that Trump properties were open for business) could be influenced to follow suit. It also could have put Trump in an awkward position – had he been more astute or informed, he might have realized a chunk of his early condo sales were to mob fronts, which could create legal and reputational risk. In the 1990s context, while Trump wasn’t charged or apparently even questioned in Bogatin’s case, the incident surely was known to him (the government seizure was public). Yet Trump continued to court Russian buyers afterwards. One could infer that the influx of criminal money made Trump somewhat **dependent on a clientele with criminal or foreign-political ties**. If many of your buyers hail from a certain milieu, you might cater to them more. However, direct “influence” in terms of Bogatin asking favors of Trump is not documented. The influence was more systemic: Bogatin helped establish a pipeline of suspect money into Trump’s assets, inadvertently giving international criminals a stake (however small) in Trump’s success.  

**Alternative Explanations:** From Trump’s perspective in the 1980s, a sale was a sale. He likely saw Bogatin as just another rich foreign investor eager to own a piece of Manhattan. At the time, few Americans knew what the Russian mob was. When Bogatin was exposed, Trump might have written it off as an isolated incident – there’s no evidence Trump tried to stop selling to similar profiles afterwards. It’s plausible Trump was willfully ignorant (a pattern seen in luxury real estate generally – “don’t ask where the money comes from”). In the 90s, with Bogatin gone, Trump Tower continued to attract various buyers; Trump could tell himself he wasn’t responsible for vetting beyond legal requirements. So while in hindsight Bogatin’s case is a glaring red flag, at the time Trump may not have internalized it as such. Thus, any influence Bogatin had was indirect and unintended by Trump. Trump might even view himself as having been *burned* by Bogatin (since the condos were seized, potentially disrupting condo association and causing bad press). If so, Trump’s later embrace of Russian buyers wasn’t because Bogatin influenced him, but because the flood of Soviet wealth in the 90s was an opportunity he wasn’t going to refuse, bad apples notwithstanding.  

**Conclusion & Significance:** David Bogatin is a historically significant figure in the Trump saga as **one of the earliest known links between Trump’s real estate and Russian organized crime** ([Salon: Trump’s deep links to organized crime: Federal investigators know and the public is catching on | Congressman Mike Quigley](https://quigley.house.gov/media-center/news-article/salon-trump-s-deep-links-organized-crime-federal-investigators-know-and#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20David%20Bogatin%3A%20In,reportedly%20personally%20sold%20to%20him)). His 1990s relevance comes from U.S. authorities recognizing his purchases as part of a laundering scheme connected to Mogilevich. This case established a **template**: corrupt post-Soviet elites converting illicit cash into New York property, with Trump Tower as a prime choice. It highlights the vulnerability of Trump’s businesses to dirty money well before he had political ambitions. For the DJT framework, Bogatin’s story underscores how long-standing and deep the roots of potential Russian influence via financial dealings go. It wasn’t just in 2016 or 2013 – as far back as 1984 and through the 90s, criminal networks from the former USSR were intertwining with Trump’s finances ([Salon: Trump’s deep links to organized crime: Federal investigators know and the public is catching on | Congressman Mike Quigley](https://quigley.house.gov/media-center/news-article/salon-trump-s-deep-links-organized-crime-federal-investigators-know-and#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20David%20Bogatin%3A%20In,reportedly%20personally%20sold%20to%20him)) ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=27%2C%202017%5D%20,According%20to)). Understanding this provides context for why investigators later scrutinized Trump properties for money laundering. Bogatin essentially opened the door that many others walked through, making him a key (if shadowy) character in Chapter 3’s landscape of financial entanglements.

### Vyacheslav “Yaponchik” Ivankov (Russian Mob Boss in U.S.)  
**Background & Context:** Vyacheslav Ivankov was a notorious Russian “vor v zakone” (thief-in-law, a high-ranking mafia title) who was dispatched by the Russian mob to New York in the early 1990s. Ivankov, known by the nickname “Yaponchik” (the Little Japanese, for his Asian features), had a fearsome reputation in Russia for extortion and murder ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=The%20arrival%20of%20Vyacheslav%20Ivankov,of%20drug%20trafficking%20in%201994)). In 1992, soon after the Soviet collapse, Mogilevich and other crime bosses sent Ivankov to Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, to consolidate Russian organized crime in the U.S. ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=The%20arrival%20of%20Vyacheslav%20Ivankov,of%20drug%20trafficking%20in%201994)). He arrived with millions in cash – legend has it he was handed $1.5 million in a suitcase at JFK airport as start-up capital ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=old%20USSR%E2%80%99s%20highest%20criminal%20rating,of%20drug%20trafficking%20in%201994)). Over the next few years, Ivankov established a sprawling criminal enterprise on American soil, engaging in extortion rackets and forging ties with U.S. and international mobsters. The FBI regarded him as the head of Russian Organized Crime in America during that period ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=him%20%241,of%20drug%20trafficking%20in%201994)) ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=Over%20the%20next%20three%20years%2C,Mafia%20to%20a%20top%20investigative)). After a massive investigation, Ivankov was arrested by the FBI in 1995, convicted of extortion in 1996, and sentenced to prison in the U.S. ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=Ivankov%20was%20convicted%20of%20a,crime%20in%20America%2C%20in%202009)). He was later deported and, in 2009, assassinated in Moscow – but during the first half of the 90s, Ivankov was the **kingpin of Russian mob activity in the States**.  

**Trump Ties:** Ivankov’s connection to Trump comes from his curious tenancy and activities around Trump properties. At some point after arriving in New York, Ivankov **moved into Trump Tower** – or at least frequented it regularly. He reportedly lived in a luxury condo on or near the 63rd floor (some accounts suggest he stayed at an associate’s unit in Trump Tower) ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=Prior%20to%20his%20arrest%2C%20the,Ivankov)). Separately, Ivankov was also linked to an art dealer, Felix Komarov, who owned an apartment in **Trump Plaza** (a different Trump building) and who allegedly laundered money for him ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=Prior%20to%20his%20arrest%2C%20the,evidence%20Trump%20knew%20him%20personally)). In fact, just weeks before the FBI nabbed Ivankov, they had been surveilling him and noted his visits to Trump Tower. When arrested, Ivankov had on his person a personal phone book with contact numbers for the Trump Organization offices in Trump Tower ([Salon: Trump’s deep links to organized crime: Federal investigators know and the public is catching on | Congressman Mike Quigley](https://quigley.house.gov/media-center/news-article/salon-trump-s-deep-links-organized-crime-federal-investigators-know-and#:~:text=reportedly%20personally%20sold%20to%20him)). This startling detail suggested he or his henchmen were in direct touch with someone in Trump’s company (possibly about real estate or business dealings). Investigative journalist Robert Friedman reported that Ivankov was **known to dine at Trump Tower’s restaurants and operate out of the building** while on the lam ([Did the FBI’s Charles McGonigal Help Throw the 2016 Election to Trump?](https://newrepublic.com/article/170328/charles-mcgonigal-throw-2016-election#:~:text=Did%20the%20FBI%E2%80%99s%20Charles%20McGonigal,held%20the%20deeds%20to)) ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=Prior%20to%20his%20arrest%2C%20the,evidence%20Trump%20knew%20him%20personally)). The Trump Organization has maintained that they had no idea of his presence – Ivankov likely was using third-party-owned condos as hideouts. There’s no evidence Trump met Ivankov, but Ivankov’s use of Trump Tower as a “home away from home” for the Russian mafia is well documented ([Did the FBI’s Charles McGonigal Help Throw the 2016 Election to Trump?](https://newrepublic.com/article/170328/charles-mcgonigal-throw-2016-election#:~:text=Did%20the%20FBI%E2%80%99s%20Charles%20McGonigal,held%20the%20deeds%20to)) ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=between%20Ivankov%20and%20New%20York,evidence%20Trump%20knew%20him%20personally)). This again placed Trump’s flagship property at the center of Russian criminal activity.  

**Network & Connections:** Ivankov, as Mogilevich’s top man in America, connected to all the aforementioned characters. He liaised with David Bogatin’s crew, worked alongside Georgian mobsters in Brighton Beach, and also interacted with Italian-American mob families in schemes (one known plot had him attempting to extort the Russian-born CEO of the firm Pan Am World Services). Ivankov’s network included **Felix Komarov** (the art dealer and money launderer who, as noted, lived in Trump Plaza and was suspected of cleaning Ivankov’s cash through art deals) ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=Prior%20to%20his%20arrest%2C%20the,evidence%20Trump%20knew%20him%20personally)). The FBI believed **Komarov and Ivankov** laundered millions and that Trump properties were one venue used – though Komarov was never charged and denied wrongdoing ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=Prior%20to%20his%20arrest%2C%20the,evidence%20Trump%20knew%20him%20personally)). Ivankov also had ties to Chechen mob groups and top “vors” across Europe. His being in Trump Tower implies that other members of his entourage (bodyguards, mistresses, etc.) were moving through Trump’s buildings, forming a little enclave. When Ivankov was arrested, the FBI’s operation (“Triumph”) involved tails in and out of Trump Tower ([Did the FBI’s Charles McGonigal Help Throw the 2016 Election to Trump?](https://newrepublic.com/article/170328/charles-mcgonigal-throw-2016-election#:~:text=Did%20the%20FBI%E2%80%99s%20Charles%20McGonigal,held%20the%20deeds%20to)). Law enforcement ultimately alerted Trump Tower’s security to assist in apprehending Ivankov, meaning the Trump Organization at least became aware of the issue at that final moment.  

**Influence Analysis:** The presence of Ivankov in Trump Tower is often cited as emblematic of the **blind eye** Trump’s business turned toward who was buying or renting his properties ([Did the FBI’s Charles McGonigal Help Throw the 2016 Election to Trump?](https://newrepublic.com/article/170328/charles-mcgonigal-throw-2016-election#:~:text=Did%20the%20FBI%E2%80%99s%20Charles%20McGonigal,held%20the%20deeds%20to)). While not influence in the traditional sense, it demonstrates a form of **infiltration** – organized crime figures literally on Trump’s home turf, potentially accessing Trump Organization staff or resources. The fact Ivankov had Trump Organization contact info could indicate someone inside facilitated things for him (knowingly or not). If an employee or associate was corrupted, that’s a direct compromise of Trump’s business by the Russian mob. Additionally, Ivankov’s ability to operate out of such a high-profile location gave him cover – which inadvertently protected him until law enforcement caught up. This scenario could have given the Russian mob a modicum of leverage: they might assume Trump or his people were “friendly” or at least permissive. Even after Ivankov’s arrest, the pattern continued – years later, other criminals (like Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov in 2013) ran rings out of Trump properties ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=In%20April%202013%2C%20the%20FBI,Olympics%2C%20and%20so%20once%20again)) ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=of%20rigging%20an%20ice,Trump%20himself%2C%20in%20November%202013)), suggesting a lax compliance culture persisted. Ivankov’s case likely sent a message back to Moscow that U.S. luxury real estate, including Trump’s, was open season for their activities. Thus, indirectly, Ivankov’s tenure increased the **interdependence between Trump’s real estate empire and Russian underground figures**. Politically, Ivankov himself didn’t seek to influence U.S. policy – he was a criminal businessman. But any kompromat or relationship established then could be repurposed later by Russian intelligence (which often colludes with mobsters). For example, knowledge of Ivankov’s time in Trump Tower could be used in propaganda or leverage attempts by Russian state actors down the line (“we sheltered in your building”).  

**Alternative Explanations:** It’s conceivable that Trump Tower was just convenient – a big building where a foreign face wouldn’t arouse suspicion among residents. Ivankov might have chosen it purely for security (lots of cameras and doormen to spot unwanted visitors) and prestige. Trump Tower staff might have had no idea who he really was (he reportedly used aliases). In this interpretation, Trump Org was a passive venue, not an active participant. Indeed, as soon as Ivankov was identified, law enforcement got him; Trump Tower security cooperated in luring him to a meeting where he was nabbed ([Did the FBI’s Charles McGonigal Help Throw the 2016 Election to Trump?](https://newrepublic.com/article/170328/charles-mcgonigal-throw-2016-election#:~:text=Did%20the%20FBI%E2%80%99s%20Charles%20McGonigal,held%20the%20deeds%20to)). This suggests that once aware, the Trump side did not protect him. So any “influence” Ivankov had was more due to Trump Org’s **negligence** rather than collusion. Trump himself likely was oblivious to the underworld drama unfolding in his building’s shadows, focusing instead on his legitimate business and celebrity. Ivankov’s arrest in 1995 didn’t publicly tarnish Trump – it was seen as an FBI victory over the mob, not a Trump scandal. Thus, one could say Ivankov’s presence was a security failure but not an intentional alliance.  

**Conclusion & Significance:** Vyacheslav Ivankov’s infiltration of Trump Tower is a vivid episode showing how **Russian criminal networks physically penetrated Trump’s sphere in the 1990s** ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=Prior%20to%20his%20arrest%2C%20the,evidence%20Trump%20knew%20him%20personally)). His story is significant because it connects the dots between global crime and Trump’s enterprises without any speculative leap – it’s documented by court records and FBI surveillance. For the DJT framework, Ivankov illustrates the porous boundary between Trump’s business and Russia’s underworld. This feeds into the larger narrative of how Russian operatives (be they mobsters or later, perhaps, agents) found Trump’s world an attractive field to operate in. It also foreshadows that when Trump ran for president, allegations of Russian mob ties (like these) would resurface and raise serious concerns. In geopolitical terms, Ivankov’s saga was part of Russia’s export of organized crime to America, which had the side effect of entwining with a future U.S. president’s private interests. Recognizing this helps explain why Trump’s rise drew intense scrutiny about past associations. Ivankov’s ghost lingered in the background as analysts parsed Trump’s unusual affinity for Russian figures. In summary, Ivankov in Trump Tower is a case study of **unwitting facilitation vs. deliberate complicity**, and either way, it underscored Trump’s vulnerability to the influence of bad actors inhabiting his space ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=Prior%20to%20his%20arrest%2C%20the,evidence%20Trump%20knew%20him%20personally)) ([Did the FBI’s Charles McGonigal Help Throw the 2016 Election to Trump?](https://newrepublic.com/article/170328/charles-mcgonigal-throw-2016-election#:~:text=Did%20the%20FBI%E2%80%99s%20Charles%20McGonigal,held%20the%20deeds%20to)).

### Felix Komarov (Art Dealer and Alleged Money Launderer)  
**Background & Context:** Felix Komarov is a Ukrainian-born art dealer who operated in New York. He was known in the 1990s as a socialite and businessman dealing in fine art and antiques, catering to Russian nouveau-riche clients. While publicly a legitimate art seller, Komarov was suspected by the FBI of being a financial facilitator for Russian organized crime, specifically for Vyacheslav Ivankov. Komarov lived in a high-end apartment in **Trump Plaza** (a residential building on Manhattan’s East Side which Trump had developed in the 1980s). In the mid-90s, U.S. authorities came to believe that Komarov helped **launder mob money through art sales** – a common scheme since art can be bought and sold for cash with subjective pricing. Komarov was never charged with a crime; he denied any mob ties. But his name appears in FBI investigations as a close associate of Ivankov during Ivankov’s U.S. stay ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=Prior%20to%20his%20arrest%2C%20the,evidence%20Trump%20knew%20him%20personally)). Essentially, Komarov straddled the worlds of culture and crime.  

**Trump Ties:** Felix Komarov’s direct tie to Trump is through real estate: he owned or leased an apartment on the 31st floor of Trump Plaza (at 167 E. 61st Street) in the 1990s ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=Prior%20to%20his%20arrest%2C%20the,evidence%20Trump%20knew%20him%20personally)). This apartment became one of the meeting places for Ivankov’s crew. According to reports, the FBI uncovered alleged links between Ivankov and Komarov “who lived on the 31st floor of Trump Plaza” and concluded Komarov had been laundering money for Ivankov ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=Prior%20to%20his%20arrest%2C%20the,evidence%20Trump%20knew%20him%20personally)). It’s not clear if Komarov also did business with Trump Organization beyond residing in Trump’s building. However, being a tenant meant he was part of Trump’s extended real-estate community. Trump Plaza staff and management (which Trump’s company oversaw in that era) would have interacted with Komarov as a resident. If large sums moved through Komarov’s accounts for condo fees or property purchases, those would have flowed into Trump-controlled accounts. Furthermore, Komarov’s social connections included attending events and charity functions – possibly some hosted by Trump or where they crossed paths. While Trump Plaza is not Trump Tower, it carried the Trump brand, and Trump was known to know many of his high-end condo owners personally (often courting them for further deals). Thus, Komarov’s use of Trump Plaza as a base for his activities implicates another Trump property in the money laundering matrix. Trump himself likely did not know of Komarov’s illicit role, but the FBI did – and it added to a pattern of Trump buildings being used by suspect characters.  

**Network & Connections:** Komarov’s network was two-fold: the art world and the mob. In the art domain, he interacted with gallery owners, auction houses, and wealthy collectors (many of them Russian or Eastern European). On the mob side, he was closely linked to **Ivankov** (whom he allegedly helped hide money and perhaps even helped hide physically at times). There were also indications he had ties to other Russian mobsters in Europe. One report noted Spanish police believed a relative of Komarov’s might have taken over Ivankov’s position in the mob after Ivankov’s jailing ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime ... - Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=Russian%20gangs%20of%20New%20York%3A,floor%20of%20the%20Trump%20Plaza)) – illustrating Komarov’s broader underworld integration. Komarov also likely knew other shady Trump clients: e.g., he moved in the same circles that included David Bogatin or other Russian businessmen in NYC. Because he was not as infamous, Komarov flew under the radar compared to Ivankov, acting as a **behind-the-scenes fixer**. His connection to Trump Plaza means his network extended to residents there – possibly other rich post-Soviet individuals lived in the building, forming a little community. For instance, one of the penthouses in Trump Plaza was owned by a Czech-born investor married to a Russian – the sort of milieu Komarov would fit right into.  

**Influence Analysis:** Komarov’s presence in a Trump property continued the trend of organized crime exploiting Trump-branded real estate as a safe haven. While Trump Plaza is somewhat separate from Trump Tower, from a reputational standpoint it’s part of Trump’s empire. If Komarov laundered, say, millions through sham art deals, some of those proceeds might have been funneled into maintaining an upscale condo – indirectly benefiting Trump’s realty business. The influence here is, again, one of **financial entwinement**: criminals like Komarov found Trump’s enterprises useful. This suggests a possible **lack of due diligence** on Trump’s part regarding buyers/tenants, which can be seen as tacit enabling of illicit actors. If such actors felt at home in Trump buildings, they might in turn spread the word in their circles – increasing Trump’s reliance on a clientele that could compromise him. However, Komarov specifically is a quieter figure; he wasn’t publicly linked to Trump (only in internal reports). So any influence was covert. The implication is more on a macro level: so many individuals with ties to Russian crime (Bogatin, Ivankov, Komarov) utilized Trump properties that, intentionally or not, Trump’s businesses became enmeshed in their money flows. Should any of those individuals have ever been leveraged by Russian intelligence, the fact they had dealings in Trump’s sphere could have created **channels of influence or information**. For example, Komarov, as a sophisticated operator, could theoretically have collected intel about rich residents, including any info about Trump’s business practices, which might later be valuable to others.  

**Alternative Explanations:** It’s conceivable that Komarov simply loved the cachet of living in a Trump property and it made it easier to impress clients (legitimate or not). He may have chosen Trump Plaza purely for location and luxury, not because of any relationship with Trump per se. Art dealing also often involves eccentric, borderline characters. Perhaps Komarov was unfairly maligned by association – maybe he did sell art to mobsters like Ivankov but wasn’t himself laundering; he could claim he was just a dealer who can’t control who buys his art. Under that benign view, Trump Plaza hosting him is unremarkable – Manhattan buildings inevitably have some residents of ill repute unbeknownst to the landlord. If Komarov truly did nothing criminal, then his only role in the narrative is guilt by association. Even if he did launder money, Trump Org might argue they can’t vet where a tenant’s income comes from beyond a certain point. Thus, Komarov’s occupancy could be chalked up to the era’s general lack of rigorous AML (anti-money laundering) enforcement in real estate.  

**Conclusion & Significance:** Felix Komarov represents the less visible facilitators who connected Russian underground wealth with assets like Trump’s properties ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=Prior%20to%20his%20arrest%2C%20the,evidence%20Trump%20knew%20him%20personally)). His story, when combined with Ivankov’s, paints a fuller picture of how **Trump’s real estate became a node in transnational money laundering networks** during the 90s. This is significant when analyzing the cumulative effect on Trump’s exposure to foreign influence. People like Komarov greased the wheels of Russian capital flight into the U.S., making fortunes in the process and normalizing that flow through respectable avenues (like high-rise condos). For the DJT framework, Komarov is another puzzle piece: not a household name, but an alleged launderer who found shelter under Trump’s roof. It underscores that by the end of the 1990s, multiple independent sources – government reports, law enforcement, journalists – were flagging Trump buildings as favored by mob-tied figures ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=Prior%20to%20his%20arrest%2C%20the,evidence%20Trump%20knew%20him%20personally)). Each individual incident might be explained away, but collectively they suggest a pattern that Trump’s enterprises were uniquely hospitable to dirty money. Komarov’s quiet role is important to document because influence is often wielded not by politicians or overt agents, but by shadowy intermediaries moving money in back rooms. He’s exactly the sort of person to look at when assessing if foreign criminal interests gained any leverage or familiarity with Trump’s inner financial workings (even if indirectly). In summary, Komarov highlights the subtle, background integration of illicit finance in Trump’s 90s world – a factor with broad implications for understanding potential influence on Trump in years to come ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=Prior%20to%20his%20arrest%2C%20the,evidence%20Trump%20knew%20him%20personally)).

## Political Operatives & Advisors (Lobbyists, Fixers, Campaign Aides)

### Roger Stone (Political Consultant and “Dirty Trickster”)  
**Background & Context:** Roger Stone is a veteran Republican operative known for his flamboyant tactics and ruthlessness. By the 1990s, Stone had already made a name in Washington – he worked on Nixon’s re-election campaign (and sports a Nixon tattoo), co-founded a powerhouse lobbying firm (Black, Manafort, Stone & Kelly), and was an architect of “dirty tricks” in campaigns. Stone and Trump’s relationship dates back to the 1980s when Stone began advising Trump informally. In 1999–2000, during the period in question, Stone was a key advisor in Trump’s short-lived exploration of a presidential run under the Reform Party banner ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=,is%20%2031%20the%20Sapir)). Stone’s ideological bend has always been less about policy and more about winning and publicity. He is also known for connections to fringe figures and conspiracy theories. In the late 90s, Stone had a falling-out with some Republican circles, which freed him to push Trump’s outsider candidacy.  

**Trump Ties:** Stone has been called Trump’s “political mentor” in some respects. As early as 1988, he urged Trump to run for office. During 1999, Trump did form an exploratory committee to seek the Reform Party’s presidential nomination (the Reform Party was founded by Ross Perot). Roger Stone served as the **chairman of that exploratory campaign** ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=,is%20%2031%20the%20Sapir)). He was essentially running Trump’s would-be campaign, setting up state organizations and handling media. Although Trump ultimately withdrew (amid chaos with rival Pat Buchanan and unwillingness to release financials), Stone’s role cemented his place as Trump’s go-to political guru outside the mainstream GOP. Stone also spent the 90s lobbying for Trump’s business interests. For example, in 1994 he helped Trump’s casino business by orchestrating a campaign against proposed Native American casinos that would compete with Trump’s – an endeavor that included controversial, racially charged ads (Stone denied wrongdoing in that). So Stone was deeply involved in Trump’s affairs both business and political throughout the decade. They also shared similar instincts for media manipulation. In 1998-99, Stone helped position Trump in the press as a possible presidential candidate, including ghost-writing an op-ed under Trump’s name in some instances. Stone’s long association means he was privy to Trump’s secrets and mindset. Importantly, Stone was the one who connected Trump with other political operatives like Paul Manafort (his former partner) and introduced Trump to Roy Cohn decades earlier ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=,just%20%243%20in%20his%20pocket)). Thus, Stone was a **linchpin in Trump’s political network**.  

**Network & Connections:** Roger Stone’s network is vast in right-wing politics. In the 90s, aside from his lobbying partners like Paul Manafort (who was then representing pro-Russian Ukrainian interests and African dictators), Stone was connected to people such as Lee Atwater (deceased by 91, but Stone carried on his legacy), conservative campaign operatives, and fringe figures like James Nolan (who later set up a fake Reform Party run to draw votes from Buchanan, allegedly at Stone’s behest). Stone also mingled in NYC society – he and his then-wife famously placed ads seeking group sex in the 90s, a scandal that briefly sidelined him, but he resurfaced. Stone’s willingness to engage with anyone useful means he interacted with figures as varied as Al Sharpton (Stone advised Sharpton’s 2004 presidential run) and far-right congressional candidates. For the Trump orbit, Stone was the **bridge** to Washington lobbying and political dark arts. Through Stone, Trump had indirect links to Manafort’s work (which by 2000 included clients like Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska via Manafort’s firm, though Manafort himself wasn’t yet working with Trump). Stone also had ties to the **media** – he was a source for gossip columns, always floating Trump rumors to generate buzz.  

**Influence Analysis:** Stone’s influence on Trump was significant in shaping Trump’s political ambitions. It was Stone who encouraged Trump to think of himself as a potential president and coached him on populist themes to run on. For instance, in 1999–2000, Trump’s Reform Party platform (ending trade deficits, railing against establishment corruption) had Stone’s fingerprints. Stone also trained Trump in the **politics of personal attack** – a Nixonian tactic Stone idolized. If Trump’s later campaign style was scorched-earth, Stone was an early tutor in that approach. Additionally, Stone’s network may have inadvertently brought Trump into contact with foreign interests: e.g., Manafort and Stone’s firm lobbied for overseas clients (some connected to dictators and possibly Russian interests) in the 90s. While speculative, it’s possible Stone’s presence meant Trump was only a degree or two separated from pro-Kremlin influence even then. However, there’s no evidence Stone directly involved Trump with foreign powers in the 90s. Instead, the influence was more **ideological and strategic** – Stone primed Trump to harness nationalist, outsider rhetoric that would later align with Russian propaganda narratives (like anti-NATO, etc., though that alignment likely emerged later by coincidence). One clear concrete influence: Stone convinced Trump to publicly attack Reform Party rival Pat Buchanan as a “Nazi” to torpedo Buchanan – a tactic that did implode the Reform Party in 2000 and served Trump’s exit. This shows Stone’s skill in manipulation that Trump benefited from.  

**Alternative Explanations:** Roger Stone has always seen himself as a showman, and teaming with Trump – a celebrity with no political filter – was naturally attractive. Trump may have kept Stone around simply because Stone fed his ego and provided a political outlet. In this view, Stone’s influence was more sycophantic than Svengali-like: he told Trump what he wanted to hear (“you can be president!”) and helped enact Trump’s impulses. When Trump backed out in 2000, it might indicate Trump wasn’t fully committed and Stone couldn’t ultimately persuade him. Stone’s foreign lobbying in the 90s likely stayed compartmentalized away from Trump; there’s little to suggest Trump engaged with Stone’s shadier clients. So Stone’s importance could be seen as *overstated* – perhaps Trump humored the Reform Party run for publicity and let Stone run with it, but Trump’s core focus remained on his business and celebrity, not genuinely building a political machine then. Under this lens, Stone was influential mainly as a hype man and organizer, not as a puppet-master.  

**Conclusion & Significance:** Roger Stone’s involvement in the 1991–2000 timeframe is crucial in understanding the genesis of Trump’s political aspirations and tactics ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=,is%20%2031%20the%20Sapir)). Stone is arguably the **first political influencer** in Trump’s camp, long before others like Steve Bannon or Paul Manafort officially came on board in 2016. He set the tone early: encouraging Trump’s flirtation with running, teaching him about wedge issues and negative campaigning, and introducing him to the anti-establishment playbook. Stone’s own connections to controversial foreign-linked lobby efforts hint at how Trump’s circle was never far from geopolitically entangled characters – even if indirectly – which becomes more relevant in retrospect. In the narrative of foreign influence, Stone himself wasn’t a foreign agent, but by guiding Trump to run on populist themes, he presaged messaging that would later dovetail with Russian strategic messaging (though in 2000, the idea of Russian interference wasn’t on the radar). Stone also stands as a through-line: he rejoins Trump in 2015-16 as an advisor for a time, proving that this relationship endured. For Chapter 3, documenting Stone shows that **Trump didn’t emerge in a political vacuum** – he was cultivated by savvy operatives like Stone in the ’90s, which set the stage for what was to come. Stone’s influence is thus both immediate (in 2000’s campaign) and lasting (in Trump’s political style and network building) ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=,just%20%243%20in%20his%20pocket)) ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=,is%20%2031%20the%20Sapir)).

### Paul Manafort (Lobbyist and Future Campaign Chairman)  
**Background & Context:** Paul Manafort is an American lobbyist and political consultant who co-founded the firm Black, Manafort, Stone & Kelly. In the 1980s, Manafort and Roger Stone were partners, mixing Republican campaign work with lobbying for foreign clients. By the early 90s, Manafort had a notorious portfolio: he represented dictators like Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines and Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, as well as business interests close to foreign governments. During 1991–2000, Manafort’s path diverged somewhat from Trump’s – they weren’t actively working together then. Manafort spent much of the 90s cultivating clients in the former Soviet bloc. Notably, in the mid-90s, Manafort (via his firm) began advising pro-Russia political figures in Ukraine. In 1995, he lobbied for the Russian energy company Gazprom’s partner in a U.S. pipeline deal ([Investigative reporter Craig Unger: "Trump has had contacts with the ...](https://www.salon.com/2018/10/11/investigative-reporter-craig-unger-trump-has-had-contacts-with-the-russian-mafia-for-35-years/#:~:text=was%20one%20of%20the%20key,but%20he%20was%20actually)). By 2000, Manafort had established connections with Oleg Deripaska (Russian oligarch) and Rinat Akhmetov (Ukrainian oligarch) through his political consulting in Eastern Europe (these relationships fully bloomed in the 2000s). He wasn’t officially in Trump’s orbit again until 2016, but his proximity via Roger Stone and mutual acquaintances remained.  

**Trump Ties:** In the late 80s, Manafort did some legal and lobbying work for Trump – for example, helping Trump navigate the federal government when he was trying to stop an Indian casino in New Jersey that threatened his casinos ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=,just%20%243%20in%20his%20pocket)). Stone and Manafort together were early Trump advisors. By 1991, Manafort’s firm had **Trump Organization as a client**, lobbying on tax issues and casino regulations. However, as the 90s progressed, Manafort became more engrossed overseas, and Trump was not politically active. A significant Trump-Manafort intersection in the 90s was through their mutual association with Russian/Ukrainian money: Manafort’s firm and Trump’s businesses were both, independently, engaging with some of the same networks. For example, in 1995 Manafort’s firm took on a contract to burnish the image of Ukraine’s Viktor Yanukovych (a Kremlin-friendly politician), funded by Ukrainian oligarchs – around the same time, Trump was selling condos to Ukrainian (and Russian) buyers. These parallel tracks didn’t cross yet, but they set the foundation for later synergy. One notable event in 1998: Trump and Manafort both attended a benefit in Manhattan honoring Russian reformist Anatoly Chubais ([Investigative reporter Craig Unger: "Trump has had contacts with the ...](https://www.salon.com/2018/10/11/investigative-reporter-craig-unger-trump-has-had-contacts-with-the-russian-mafia-for-35-years/#:~:text=was%20one%20of%20the%20key,but%20he%20was%20actually)) – indicating they moved in similar circles concerned with Russia. It’s worth mentioning that Manafort lived in Trump Tower starting 2006; while that’s outside the 90s, the decision to live there might stem from familiarity dating back to earlier collaboration or Stone’s influence. In 1999-2000, when Stone was steering Trump’s Reform Party adventure, Manafort was not publicly involved (he was busy with international clients), but one can imagine Stone consulted him.  

**Network & Connections:** Manafort’s 90s network was a who’s who of globally powerful but ethically dubious figures. This included Russian oligarchs (Deripaska), Ukrainian oligarchs (Akhmetov, Firtash by association), and even Kremlin officials (through lobbying on behalf of pro-Russia causes). Domestically, Manafort was connected to the Republican establishment – he was Bob Dole’s convention manager in 1996, for instance ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=,just%20%243%20in%20his%20pocket)). He also remained close to Roger Stone and their old firm’s alumni (like Charlie Black). So Manafort was a nexus between U.S. politics and post-Soviet money. If any influence reached Trump from Russia in the 90s through political channels, Manafort would be the likely conduit. However, no evidence shows Manafort tried to introduce Trump to his foreign clients at that time. It was more that Manafort’s services to oligarchs paralleled oligarchs investing in Trump’s properties – a sign of a broader confluence of interests.  

**Influence Analysis:** While Manafort did not directly advise Trump in the 1990s politically, his role is important in hindsight. Manafort was essentially **cultivating Russian and Ukrainian benefactors** throughout the 90s, the same benefactors who by the 2000s took interest in Trump. For instance, Oleg Deripaska (for whom Manafort became a consultant) would later partner with Trump’s business (buying a Trump mansion in 2008 for $95M ([Business projects of Donald Trump in Russia - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_projects_of_Donald_Trump_in_Russia#:~:text=,certainly%20with%20%20407%20our))). One could argue Manafort helped **widen the Kremlin-linked elite’s access to American figures**, and Trump, as a known quantity via Stone, was likely on that radar. Manafort’s firm’s presence in Trump Tower (since Stone’s office was there) and later his residency created an informal info pipeline. If Russian intel was monitoring Manafort (which is likely, given his deep involvement in their sphere), they would also observe his longtime association with Trump. This might have contributed to the idea of Trump as a potential asset/friend (as Yuri Shvets, ex-KGB, later alleged) ([Russia has been cultivating Trump as an asset for 40 years, former KGB spy says](https://www.ordo-militaris.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Russia-has-been-cultivating-Trump-as-an-asset-for-40-years-former-KGB-spy-says.pdf#:~:text=Shvets%20told%20The%20Guardian%20that,the%20Czech%20model%20Ivana%20Zelnickova)). Thus Manafort’s influence can be seen as **priming the landscape**: by 2000, key Russian interests had both Manafort and Trump as friendly Americans in their orbit, albeit in different capacities. 

**Alternative Explanations:** It’s plausible to see Manafort’s and Trump’s 90s trajectories as largely separate – Manafort chasing foreign riches, Trump rebuilding his brand. Their link was mostly Roger Stone. Manafort himself might not have thought much about Trump in those years; indeed, Manafort told people in the mid-2000s that he was surprised when Trump actually ran for office. So Manafort’s influence on Trump in the 90s was minimal on the surface. If anything, one might argue Trump influenced Manafort’s client Yanukovych: Manafort gave Yanukovych a makeover including styling him as a populist man-of-the-people – a strategy Manafort might have honed watching Trump’s media antics. But that’s speculative. Realistically, Manafort didn’t play a visible advisory role for Trump then. So his “influence” is more contextual – part of the same ecosystem but not actively steering Trump in that decade.  

**Conclusion & Significance:** Including Paul Manafort in the 1991–2000 report provides continuity and foreshadowing. It shows that **one of Trump’s future top campaign men was already entangled with pro-Russian interests in the 90s**. Manafort’s activities demonstrated how foreign political money seeped into D.C. and New York consultancy circles – a trend that dovetailed with foreign money seeping into Trump’s real estate. By profiling Manafort here, we mark that by 2000, two paths – Trump’s ambition and Manafort’s Kremlin-adjacent work – were running in parallel, set to intersect spectacularly in 2016. Manafort is also a reminder that not all influence is obvious or immediate; sometimes the significance of a relationship (Trump-Manafort) only becomes clear later. In the 90s, Manafort was just another lobbyist friend of Trump’s; in retrospect, he was a **vector for Russian influence** once circumstances aligned. Thus, his inclusion helps map the network of people who, knowingly or not, connected Trump to the wider geopolitical game. The implications of Manafort’s 90s ties became stark when he was prosecuted in 2018 for concealing lobbying for pro-Russian Ukrainians – indicating just how deeply he was in that camp. For Trump’s Chapter 3 narrative, Manafort’s story underscores the gradual merging of Trump’s circle with Russian political interests as the Cold War gave way to a chaotic new world order ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=,just%20%243%20in%20his%20pocket)) ([Donald Trump's Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and his Russian business ties - ICIJ](https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/donald-trumps-commerce-secretary-wilbur-ross-and-his-russian-business-ties/#:~:text=Trump%20in%201990%20when%20the,assist%20for%20the%20future%20president)).

Trump sits at the center, with financial actors on the left (e.g., Al-Waleed bin Talal’s cash infusions, Mogilevich network money flowing into Trump properties via Bogatin/Ivankov/Komarov ([Salon: Trump’s deep links to organized crime: Federal investigators know and the public is catching on | Congressman Mike Quigley](https://quigley.house.gov/media-center/news-article/salon-trump-s-deep-links-organized-crime-federal-investigators-know-and#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20David%20Bogatin%3A%20In,reportedly%20personally%20sold%20to%20him)) ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=Prior%20to%20his%20arrest%2C%20the,evidence%20Trump%20knew%20him%20personally))), and political operatives on the right (e.g., Roger Stone advising Trump’s 2000 campaign ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=,is%20%2031%20the%20Sapir)), Paul Manafort’s parallel ties to pro-Russian interests). Intelligence-linked figures (e.g., Shvets, Ivana’s father) connect at the bottom, highlighting surveillance and cultivation efforts ([Russia has been cultivating Trump as an asset for 40 years, former KGB spy says](https://www.ordo-militaris.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Russia-has-been-cultivating-Trump-as-an-asset-for-40-years-former-KGB-spy-says.pdf#:~:text=Shvets%20told%20The%20Guardian%20that,the%20Czech%20model%20Ivana%20Zelnickova)). This visual underscores how, by 2000, Trump’s sphere had become intersected by multiple international networks – financial, political, and covert.* ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=Prior%20to%20his%20arrest%2C%20the,evidence%20Trump%20knew%20him%20personally)) ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=,is%20%2031%20the%20Sapir))

## **Timeline: Key Interactions (1991–2000)**

- **1991:** Facing financial ruin, **Trump receives a lifeline from Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal**, who buys Trump’s yacht for ~$20M, injecting needed cash ([Trump’s Conflicts of Interest in Saudi Arabia - Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/trumps-conflicts-interest-saudi-arabia/#:~:text=purchased%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20yacht%2C%20Trump%20Princess%2C,highlighted%20how%20he%20twice%20bailed)). Ex-KGB agent **Yuri Shvets later alleges** that around this time Russian intelligence began seeing Trump as an asset to cultivate ([Russia has been cultivating Trump as an asset for 40 years, former KGB spy says](https://www.ordo-militaris.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Russia-has-been-cultivating-Trump-as-an-asset-for-40-years-former-KGB-spy-says.pdf#:~:text=Shvets%20told%20The%20Guardian%20that,the%20Czech%20model%20Ivana%20Zelnickova)).  
- **1993–94:** **Vyacheslav Ivankov**, Russian mafia boss sent by Mogilevich, arrives in New York ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=The%20arrival%20of%20Vyacheslav%20Ivankov,of%20drug%20trafficking%20in%201994)). He embeds himself in Trump Tower by 1994, using it as a base while on the run ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=Prior%20to%20his%20arrest%2C%20the,evidence%20Trump%20knew%20him%20personally)). **Felix Komarov** in Trump Plaza allegedly launders money for Ivankov during this period ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=Prior%20to%20his%20arrest%2C%20the,evidence%20Trump%20knew%20him%20personally)).  
- **1995:** Trump’s creditors force sale of the **Plaza Hotel**. Al-Waleed bin Talal leads the purchase for $325M, effectively bailing Trump out again ([Trump’s Conflicts of Interest in Saudi Arabia - Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/trumps-conflicts-interest-saudi-arabia/#:~:text=purchased%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20yacht%2C%20Trump%20Princess%2C,highlighted%20how%20he%20twice%20bailed)). **Wilbur Ross**, as Trump’s casino bondholder rep, engineers a deal to keep Trump in business, telling creditors the “Trump name is still an asset” ([Donald Trump's Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and his Russian business ties - ICIJ](https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/donald-trumps-commerce-secretary-wilbur-ross-and-his-russian-business-ties/#:~:text=Trump%20in%201990%20when%20the,assist%20for%20the%20future%20president)). Meanwhile, **Roger Stone** begins encouraging Trump to run for president as Reform Party tensions rise.  
- **1996:** **Trump travels to Moscow** with Howard Lorber and meets Moscow’s Mayor Yuri Luzhkov to scout building projects ([Business projects of Donald Trump in Russia - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_projects_of_Donald_Trump_in_Russia#:~:text=,deal%20to%20build%20a%20Trump)). Though no deal materializes, Trump trademarks his name in Russia and gains visibility ([Business projects of Donald Trump in Russia - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_projects_of_Donald_Trump_in_Russia#:~:text=,deal%20to%20build%20a%20Trump)). Back in NYC, FBI arrests Ivankov outside Trump Tower, finding Trump Org phone numbers in his notes ([Salon: Trump’s deep links to organized crime: Federal investigators know and the public is catching on | Congressman Mike Quigley](https://quigley.house.gov/media-center/news-article/salon-trump-s-deep-links-organized-crime-federal-investigators-know-and#:~:text=reportedly%20personally%20sold%20to%20him)). Ivankov’s reign in Trump’s midst ends, but the Russian mob’s use of Trump properties is exposed.  
- **1997–98:** **Semion Mogilevich’s money laundering** operation through the Bank of New York ramps up, moving billions out of Russia ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=The%20mob%20were%20believed%20to,the%20Bank%20of%20New%20York)). Some of this hot money finds its way into luxury U.S. real estate. **Sam Kislin**, now a prominent trader and Giuliani donor, in **1998 provides mortgages to Russian buyers of Trump World Tower condos** as Russia’s economy collapses ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=Trump%20begins%20selling%20units%20in,By)). Trump begins selling units in Trump World Tower (under construction) and by 1999 a significant portion are snapped up by ex-Soviet investors ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=Trump%20begins%20selling%20units%20in,By)). Kislin’s financing bridges Russian capital to Trump’s project.  
- **1999:** Trump, egged on by **Roger Stone**, announces an exploratory run for president with the Reform Party ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=,is%20%2031%20the%20Sapir)). Stone serves as campaign chairman. Through Stone, Trump’s platform takes shape (populist, anti-establishment). **Paul Manafort**, though not formally involved, is looped in via Stone’s network; at the same time, Manafort begins working for Ukrainian oligarchs – a convergence of Trump’s circle and Russian interests is quietly forming ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=,just%20%243%20in%20his%20pocket)).  
- **2000:** Trump participates in Reform Party primaries briefly, then withdraws by February, denouncing rival Pat Buchanan (a gambit orchestrated by Stone) ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=,is%20%2031%20the%20Sapir)). **Felix Sater**, a Russian-American businessman with mob ties (and an FBI informant), meets Trump Organization executives this year, setting the stage for Bayrock Group’s partnerships in the 2000s ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=Organization%20www,Tamir%20Sapir)). By end of 2000, **Tevfik Arif** (Bayrock founder) and Sater are positioning to work with Trump – individuals with Soviet backgrounds entering Trump’s business circle as Chapter 3 closes.

## Conclusion & Implications (1991–2000):

By the year 2000, Donald J. Trump’s realm — though ostensibly focused on real estate and a quixotic political dalliance — had become a crossroads of global forces. Financially, he was **kept afloat by foreign money**: from Saudi royals to shadowy post-Soviet moguls, an array of non-traditional financiers stepped in where U.S. banks wouldn’t ([Trump’s Conflicts of Interest in Saudi Arabia - Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/trumps-conflicts-interest-saudi-arabia/#:~:text=purchased%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20yacht%2C%20Trump%20Princess%2C,highlighted%20how%20he%20twice%20bailed)) ([Salon: Trump’s deep links to organized crime: Federal investigators know and the public is catching on | Congressman Mike Quigley](https://quigley.house.gov/media-center/news-article/salon-trump-s-deep-links-organized-crime-federal-investigators-know-and#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20David%20Bogatin%3A%20In,reportedly%20personally%20sold%20to%20him)). Politically, Trump was **mentored by unconventional operatives** like Roger Stone, who injected anti-establishment ideas and forged early links between Trump and nationalist rhetoric ([Timeline: Everything We Know About Russia and President Trump](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-trump-resistance-plan-a-timeline-russia-and-president-trump/#:~:text=,is%20%2031%20the%20Sapir)). On the covert side, **former agents and mobsters orbited his world** – whether it was Russian mob bosses literally living in Trump properties ([Russian gangs of New York: Putin's new order | Crime+Investigation UK](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/russian-gangs-of-new-york-part-2-putins-new-order#:~:text=Prior%20to%20his%20arrest%2C%20the,evidence%20Trump%20knew%20him%20personally)) or intelligence operatives taking note of Trump’s rise and perhaps nudging it along ([Russia has been cultivating Trump as an asset for 40 years, former KGB spy says](https://www.ordo-militaris.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Russia-has-been-cultivating-Trump-as-an-asset-for-40-years-former-KGB-spy-says.pdf#:~:text=Shvets%20told%20The%20Guardian%20that,the%20Czech%20model%20Ivana%20Zelnickova)).

Crucially, many of these individuals acted not in concert but in parallel – their influence on Trump was cumulative. At times, Trump was likely unaware of the undercurrents (e.g., he may not have known he was effectively **helped by Mogilevich’s network laundering money through his condos**, but he reaped the benefit ([Salon: Trump’s deep links to organized crime: Federal investigators know and the public is catching on | Congressman Mike Quigley](https://quigley.house.gov/media-center/news-article/salon-trump-s-deep-links-organized-crime-federal-investigators-know-and#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20David%20Bogatin%3A%20In,reportedly%20personally%20sold%20to%20him))). In other cases, he was an active participant (welcoming Stone’s political counsel, or accepting Al-Waleed’s deal-making). The late 90s thus cast the die for the 21st century: Trump emerged from near-bankruptcy **financially entangled with foreign interests** and **politically styled in outsider populism**, both conditions ripe for exploitation by a foreign power. 

While alternative explanations exist for each tie (many dealings were “just business” on the surface), the **pattern of Trump’s associations** by 2000 is striking. Nearly every major rescue or partnership came from actors outside the American mainstream, some with clear **links to authoritarian regimes or criminal enterprises**. This provided multiple points of potential leverage. For instance, any knowledge Mogilevich had of money laundering through Trump properties could be later used to pressure Trump (even if Trump wasn’t complicit, the mere connection is compromising) ([Salon: Trump’s deep links to organized crime: Federal investigators know and the public is catching on | Congressman Mike Quigley](https://quigley.house.gov/media-center/news-article/salon-trump-s-deep-links-organized-crime-federal-investigators-know-and#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20David%20Bogatin%3A%20In,reportedly%20personally%20sold%20to%20him)). Likewise, Stone’s and Manafort’s deep Russian connections laid groundwork for channels of influence to Trump in the future (as indeed happened in 2016). 

In summary, the individuals profiled in Chapter 3 reveal a **portrait of Trump’s orbit in the 1990s as porous to foreign influence** – financially through illicit funds and wealthy saviors, politically through maverick operatives courted by foreign powers, and personally through social contacts monitored or cultivated by intelligence. Each person’s story adds a piece to the puzzle of how Donald Trump, by the turn of the millennium, was uniquely situated at the nexus of international finance, crime, and politics. These findings highlight gaps for further investigation: e.g., the full extent of money laundering in Trump’s ventures, the degree of FBI knowledge and warnings given (or not given) to Trump about these characters, and how much Trump understood about the risks. Going forward, subsequent chapters will build on this foundation, examining how these ties evolved – whether they were severed or strengthened – and how they ultimately converged in influencing the U.S. election and policy. 

**Implications:** The 1991–2000 period was not just formative for Trump’s business recovery; it unknowingly **set the stage for geopolitical entanglements**. When assessing Trump’s decisions and vulnerabilities in later years (e.g., his curious affinity for Russian President Vladimir Putin), the groundwork uncovered in Chapter 3 cannot be ignored. The convergence of interests – Russian oligarchs needing safe assets, Trump needing capital; populist politics in America, Russia’s desire to weaken U.S. establishment figures – created a perfect storm around Donald Trump. The individuals in this report each illuminate a facet of that storm. Together, they suggest that Trump’s road to the presidency was paved, at least in part, by actors with loyalties beyond U.S. borders. Understanding their roles in the 90s provides critical insight into why, in the years to come, Donald Trump would be both an appealing partner to foreign power brokers and a security concern to many in the American intelligence community. 

**Gaps/Future Research:** While we have substantial open-source evidence of these connections, areas like **Trump’s knowledge of and response to mob infiltration** (did he take any action after Ivankov’s arrest?), or **the internal deliberations of his 2000 campaign** (emails, memos, possibly held by Stone or Manafort) remain opaque. Also, **financial records** that could detail suspicious condo sales or payments (e.g., Kislin’s loan documents, Bank of Cyprus records involving Wilbur Ross and Trump) would further illuminate these relationships. These represent threads that future investigators – congressional, journalistic, or law enforcement – should continue to pull. The Chapter 3 era teaches us that influence often germinates in the shadows years before it manifests in plain sight. Keeping a retrospective eye on these early entanglements is key to unraveling the full scope of the Donald J. Trump framework in the chapters that follow.
