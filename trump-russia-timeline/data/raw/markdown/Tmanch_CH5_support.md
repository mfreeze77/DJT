# Chapter 5 – Key Individuals researched for Tmanch_CH5.md (2015–2021)

## Donald Trump Jr.  
 ([File:Donald Trump, Jr. (51770696331).jpg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Donald_Trump,_Jr._(51770696331).jpg)) *Donald Trump Jr., eldest son of Donald Trump and executive in the Trump Organization.*  

**Background:** Donald John Trump Jr. (born 1977) is a businessman and the eldest son of Donald J. Trump ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20most%20infamous,Russians%20promising%20damaging%20Clinton%20intel)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=2,Meeting)). As an Executive Vice President of the Trump Organization, he managed international projects and was active in his father’s 2016 presidential campaign. He has no formal government experience, but his prominent family role granted him significant influence and access during the campaign and transition.  

**Interactions with Trump:** Trump Jr. has been one of his father’s closest political surrogates. During the 2016 campaign, he participated in key meetings on behalf of his father. Notably, in June 2016 he accepted a meeting at Trump Tower with individuals presented as having official Russian information harmful to Hillary Clinton ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20most%20infamous,Russians%20promising%20damaging%20Clinton%20intel)). Emails later released by Trump Jr. himself show he welcomed the offer of “official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary” as “part of Russia and its government’s support” for his father, replying, “if it’s what you say I love it” ([Donald Trump Jr. replied ‘love it’ when told of Russian ... - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/11/donald-trump-jr-posts-email-chain-setting-up-meeting-with-russian-lawyer-240402#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%20Jr,information%20about%20Hillary%20Clinton)) ([Trump Jr. email on potential Russian Hillary info: "I love it" - Axios](https://www.axios.com/2017/12/15/trump-jr-email-on-potential-russian-hillary-info-i-love-it-1513304115#:~:text=Trump%20Jr,of%20Russia%20and%20its)). Trump Jr. was also involved in messaging strategy around emerging stories of Russian contacts (for example, initially describing the Trump Tower meeting as about adoption policy). He was never an official White House staffer, but remained a close advisor and traveled in elite circles that overlapped with foreign contacts.  

**Financial, Criminal, and Political Connections:** Trump Jr. has been a focus of investigations for his Russian contacts. He was a key figure in inquiries by Congress and Special Counsel Robert Mueller into possible campaign coordination with Russia. He admitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee that the June 9, 2016 meeting was arranged after promises of damaging Clinton information from a Russian source ([Trump Jr. says in emails he’d ‘love’ to see Russian info on Clinton](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-jr-says-emails-hed-love-see-russian-info-clinton#:~:text=Trump%20Jr,one%20response%2C%20Trump%20Jr)). While Mueller’s final report did not charge Trump Jr. with a crime, it noted his willingness to receive foreign assistance ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=4)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20most%20infamous,Russians%20promising%20damaging%20Clinton%20intel)). Politically, Trump Jr. became an outspoken advocate of his father’s agenda and cultivated relationships with conservative activists, including those with Russia-friendly views (for instance, he was an invited guest at NRA events attended by Russian nationals in 2016). However, no direct financial entanglements with Russian business have been documented beyond the Trump Organization deals managed with his father.  

**Role in the Network:** Within Trump’s orbit, Donald Trump Jr. functioned as a conduit to outside influencers and a champion of his father’s interests. He was an “insider” with the surname authority to arrange meetings (like the Trump Tower meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya) and to interface with figures like publicist Rob Goldstone and Azerbaijani-Russian pop star Emin Agalarov (who helped initiate that meeting) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20most%20infamous,Russians%20promising%20damaging%20Clinton%20intel)) ([Trump Jr. when a Russian lawyer offered dirt on Clinton: “I love it”](https://www.vice.com/en/article/here-are-donald-trump-jr-s-emails-with-a-kremlin-connected-lawyer/#:~:text=Trump%20Jr,his%20father%E2%80%99s%20former%20Russian)). His actions indicated an openness to foreign assistance, which is a pivotal point in assessing the Trump campaign’s receptivity to Russian influence. In the post-election period, Trump Jr. has continued to amplify his father’s political messaging. In the context of potential foreign leverage, Trump Jr. represents how Trump’s own family members were points of contact for outreach from Kremlin-connected individuals, making him a key node in any influence network surrounding Donald Trump ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20most%20infamous,Russians%20promising%20damaging%20Clinton%20intel)) ([Trump Jr. says in emails he’d ‘love’ to see Russian info on Clinton](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-jr-says-emails-hed-love-see-russian-info-clinton#:~:text=Trump%20Jr,one%20response%2C%20Trump%20Jr)).  

**Sources & Citations:** Donald Trump Jr.’s email correspondence arranging the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting is documented in his own disclosures and media reports ([Trump Jr. email on potential Russian Hillary info: "I love it" - Axios](https://www.axios.com/2017/12/15/trump-jr-email-on-potential-russian-hillary-info-i-love-it-1513304115#:~:text=Trump%20Jr,of%20Russia%20and%20its)) ([Trump Jr. says in emails he’d ‘love’ to see Russian info on Clinton](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-jr-says-emails-hed-love-see-russian-info-clinton#:~:text=Trump%20Jr,one%20response%2C%20Trump%20Jr)). The Mueller Report and Senate Intelligence Committee Volume 5 describe his role in that meeting and the broader campaign contacts with Russians ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=4)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20most%20infamous,Russians%20promising%20damaging%20Clinton%20intel)). His statements to Congress on the matter are part of the public record (Senate Judiciary Committee, Sep. 2017). No criminal charges were filed against him, but Senate investigators concluded his eager response to offers of help constituted a serious counterintelligence concern ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,refuting%20claims%20of%20a%20hoax)).

## Jared Kushner  
 ([File:170403-D-PB383-034 (32979771654).jpg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:170403-D-PB383-034_(32979771654).jpg)) *Jared Kushner, senior advisor and son-in-law to President Trump, in 2017.*  

**Background:** Jared Kushner (born 1981) is a real estate developer who became Donald Trump’s son-in-law and a senior White House advisor. Married to Ivanka Trump, Kushner entered the 2016 campaign with no prior government experience but a background managing his family’s real estate firm. During the presidential transition and Trump’s term, Kushner was given an expansive portfolio, including Middle East policy and government modernization. He was a key point of contact for foreign officials due to his trusted family status ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=3)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)).  

**Interactions with Trump:** Kushner was deeply embedded in Trump’s campaign and administration. He helped oversee digital strategy during 2016 and, after Trump’s victory, he acted as an emissary to foreign powers during the transition ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=3)). Notably, in December 2016, Kushner met Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and discussed the possibility of establishing a private backchannel of communication with Moscow using Russian diplomatic facilities ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,The%20Atlantic)). This proposal – to use secure Russian channels to communicate with the Kremlin, reportedly to evade U.S. intelligence monitoring – was highly unorthodox and raised immediate red flags in the intelligence community ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,The%20Atlantic)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)). Kushner also joined Michael Flynn in meetings with Kislyak and later with the head of a Russian state-owned bank (Sergey Gorkov) during the transition, encounters examined by the Mueller probe ([Michael Flynn's Russia Timeline - FactCheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2017/12/michael-flynns-russia-timeline/#:~:text=Dec,meeting%20occurred%20until%20it)) ([The Russia investigation and Donald Trump: a timeline](https://www.politifact.com/article/2018/feb/15/russia-investigation-and-donald-trump-timeline-rec/#:~:text=The%20Russia%20investigation%20and%20Donald,run%20Russian%20bank%20under)). As a senior advisor in 2017, Kushner continued to influence Trump’s foreign policy, often advocating positions aligned with his personal networks and business interests.  

**Financial, Criminal, and Political Connections:** Investigations revealed that Kushner had numerous contacts with foreign officials, including Russians, which he initially omitted from his security clearance forms (he later updated the forms to include over 100 foreign contacts) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=3)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)). While he was not charged with wrongdoing, the FBI scrutinized his December 2016 communications. U.S. intelligence intercepted Kislyak reporting to Moscow that Kushner suggested using Russian facilities for a secret channel ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,The%20Atlantic)). Kushner also attended the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Veselnitskaya, though he later said he left early when the discussion turned to sanctions policy and adoption, indicating he viewed it as a “waste of time.” Politically, Kushner was a moderating voice on some issues but also supported Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey – an event Mueller investigated for obstruction. His business ties (e.g. seeking foreign financing for 666 Fifth Ave.) and the convergence of those interests with his official role raised potential conflicts of interest. However, he was never accused of a crime in the Russia inquiries.  

**Role in the Network:** Kushner functioned as a **central node** linking Trump to foreign interlocutors ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=3)). In the context of Russia, he was both a facilitator of communications (meeting Kislyak, Gorkov) and a policy influencer once in office (e.g. arguing for more pragmatic Russia relations during the transition). His attempt to establish a secret line to the Kremlin suggests he sought a level of direct dialogue outside normal channels, a move consistent with someone potentially furthering a hidden agenda or at least extraordinarily trusting of the Russian side ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,The%20Atlantic)). As family, Kushner’s advice carried great weight with Trump. He played a behind-the-scenes role in shaping the administration’s responses to the Russia investigations as well. Overall, Kushner’s inclusion in discussions with Kremlin-connected actors (and his presence at the June 2016 meeting) made him a significant focus in evaluating foreign influence on the incoming administration ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,The%20Atlantic)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)).  

**Sources & Citations:** Kushner’s proposal for a backchannel to Moscow was reported in contemporary news and later confirmed by officials and the Mueller investigation ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,The%20Atlantic)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)). Congressional testimony (July 2017) and the Senate Intelligence Committee’s findings detail his contacts with Kislyak and Gorkov ([The Russia investigation and Donald Trump: a timeline](https://www.politifact.com/article/2018/feb/15/russia-investigation-and-donald-trump-timeline-rec/#:~:text=The%20Russia%20investigation%20and%20Donald,run%20Russian%20bank%20under)). His role in the Trump Tower meeting is documented in emails and testimonies ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20most%20infamous,Russians%20promising%20damaging%20Clinton%20intel)). These incidents underscore Kushner’s central involvement in Trump’s Russia interactions without resulting in charges, highlighting counterintelligence concerns rather than criminal ones.

## Felix Sater  
**Background:** Felix Sater (born 1966 in the Soviet Union) is a Russian-American real estate developer and former managing director of Bayrock Group, a firm that partnered with the Trump Organization on multiple projects ([Felix Sater - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Sater#:~:text=Felix%20Henry%20Sater%20%2F%20%CB%88,and%20the%20%2061)) ([Felix Sater - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Sater#:~:text=and%20former%20managing%20director%20of,and%20the%20%2061)). Sater has a checkered past: he pleaded guilty in 1998 to a $40 million stock fraud scheme linked to organized crime and became an informant for the FBI ([Felix Sater - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Sater#:~:text=In%201998%2C%20Sater%20pleaded%20guilty,11)). Despite his criminal record, Sater maintained business ties with Donald Trump. He worked out of Trump Tower and helped spearhead efforts to develop a Trump Tower Moscow. Sater often boasted of his high-level contacts in Russia, including connections to Vladimir Putin’s circle ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Vanity%20Fair)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=%2A%20Felix%20Sater%20Emails%3A%20Russia,Testimony%3B%20%E2%80%9CTrump%27s%20Moscow%20Tower%20and)).  

**Interactions with Trump:** Sater acted as a deal-maker on Trump’s behalf in Russia. Notably, during the presidential campaign in 2015-2016, Sater served as an intermediary for the Trump Organization’s secret negotiations to build a luxury tower in Moscow ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Vanity%20Fair)). In emails to Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen in 2015, Sater urged moving forward with the Moscow project, writing “I will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected” – suggesting that backing from the Kremlin on the real estate deal could “engineer” Trump’s election ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Vanity%20Fair)). He claimed he could secure Putin’s support and hinted at synergy between the deal and Trump’s political ambitions ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Vanity%20Fair)). Sater accompanied Cohen to meetings and outreach related to the project, even attempting to arrange for Trump to travel to Russia during the campaign to personally promote the tower ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=%2A%20Felix%20Sater%20Emails%3A%20Russia,Testimony%3B%20%E2%80%9CTrump%27s%20Moscow%20Tower%20and)) ([Felix Sater - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Sater#:~:text=During%20Donald%20Trump%27s%202016%20presidential,of%20a%20false%20joint%20defense)). Although Trump never went, Sater’s communications show he aggressively courted Russian officials (through intermediaries) for the project well into 2016, while Trump publicly denied business in Russia ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=%2A%20Continued%20Negotiations%20Through%20Mid,Channel%20Ukraine%20Dossier%E2%80%9D%20%28Just%20Security)). 

**Financial, Criminal, and Political Connections:** Felix Sater’s ties blend business with shadowy elements. He was linked to Russian oligarchs and mob figures through past crimes ([Felix Sater - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Sater#:~:text=In%201998%2C%20Sater%20pleaded%20guilty,11)). His work as an informant put him in contact with U.S. intelligence, yet he simultaneously pursued lucrative deals in Russia. Politically, Sater was not formally part of the campaign, but his efforts directly intersected with Trump’s presidential run. The Moscow tower deal he pushed (under a signed Letter of Intent) would have bestowed a $50 million penthouse to Putin as a marketing ploy ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Vanity%20Fair)) ([Felix Sater - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Sater#:~:text=During%20Donald%20Trump%27s%202016%20presidential,of%20a%20false%20joint%20defense)), illustrating a proposed financial favor to a foreign leader while Trump was running for office. Sater’s role drew scrutiny from Congress and Mueller: Cohen testified that Sater acted as the “point person” on the Moscow project ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Despite%20public%20denials%20of%20%E2%80%9Cno)). Sater was subpoenaed by the House Intelligence Committee in 2019 regarding these matters ([Felix Sater - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Sater#:~:text=During%20Donald%20Trump%27s%202016%20presidential,of%20a%20false%20joint%20defense)). However, he was not charged by Mueller; instead, Cohen (who cooperated) pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the duration of the Moscow deal talks (which went on through June 2016) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=%2A%20Continued%20Negotiations%20Through%20Mid,Channel%20Ukraine%20Dossier%E2%80%9D%20%28Just%20Security)). 

**Role in the Network:** Sater functioned as a **go-between** linking Trump’s inner circle to Russian officials and businessmen. In the context of a “Manchurian Candidate” analysis, Sater is significant for introducing a potential channel of Russian leverage: the Trump Tower Moscow deal ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=Trump%20consistently%20told%20the%20public,question%20stands%20to%20gain%20financially)). By actively engaging Putin’s office (he encouraged Cohen to reach out to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov) and dangling business incentives, Sater created a situation where the Kremlin’s approval (or denial) of the project could be used to influence Trump ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=Trump%20consistently%20told%20the%20public,question%20stands%20to%20gain%20financially)). Even though the deal did not materialize, the episode demonstrated how foreign interests (through figures like Sater) sought to cultivate financial entanglements with Trump during the campaign. Sater’s enthusiastic emails to Cohen – “Buddy our boy can become President of the USA and we can engineer it” – imply he viewed geopolitical dealings as intertwined with Trump’s political success ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,project%20remained%20active%20into%20June)). Thus, Sater was a catalyst for possible foreign leverage, operating somewhat in the shadows but leaving a documentary trail.  

**Sources & Citations:** Felix Sater’s background is detailed in court records and media profiles (his Bayrock tenure and 1998 conviction) ([Felix Sater - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Sater#:~:text=In%201998%2C%20Sater%20pleaded%20guilty,11)) ([Felix Sater - The Moscow Project](https://themoscowproject.org/players/felixsater/index.html#:~:text=Bayrock%20Group%20partnered%20with%20the,fraud%20scheme)). The Trump Tower Moscow negotiations are well documented by Cohen’s Senate testimony and emails, some of which have been quoted in Special Counsel Mueller’s filings ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,project%20remained%20active%20into%20June)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=%2A%20Continued%20Negotiations%20Through%20Mid,Channel%20Ukraine%20Dossier%E2%80%9D%20%28Just%20Security)). Sater’s quoted boasts about getting Putin’s backing and helping Trump win appear in investigative reports and were referenced in congressional hearings ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,project%20remained%20active%20into%20June)). The Reuters report (Jan 2019) and Mueller Report summarize Sater’s role in these clandestine dealings ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Vanity%20Fair)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=%2A%20Continued%20Negotiations%20Through%20Mid,Channel%20Ukraine%20Dossier%E2%80%9D%20%28Just%20Security)). Sater himself testified to the House Intelligence Committee in 2019 (in closed session) about these events, confirming much of his involvement as a facilitator for the Moscow project while Trump pursued the presidency.

## Michael Cohen  
**Background:** Michael Cohen (born 1966) is an American lawyer who served as Donald Trump’s personal attorney and “fixer” for over a decade. He was Executive Vice-President of the Trump Organization and was deeply involved in Trump’s business and personal dealings. During the 2016 campaign, Cohen remained Trump’s close confidant, handling sensitive matters. In 2017, he held no formal White House role but continued to advise Trump informally until falling out amid legal troubles. Cohen’s loyalty to Trump earned him a reputation as someone who would “take a bullet” for his boss – a stance he later reversed when facing prosecution ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,3)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,of%20personal%20or%20unexplained%20motives)).  

**Interactions with Trump:** As Trump’s personal lawyer, Cohen was at the center of the Trump Tower Moscow project negotiations. Throughout 2015 and early 2016, Cohen communicated with Russian representatives (including a press secretary in Vladimir Putin’s office) seeking approval for the Moscow building deal ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=%2A%20Continued%20Negotiations%20Through%20Mid,Channel%20Ukraine%20Dossier%E2%80%9D%20%28Just%20Security)). He kept Trump updated on these developments and even planned a potential trip for Trump to Moscow during the campaign (which ultimately did not occur). Cohen also interacted with Felix Sater on the deal; their email exchanges show Cohen agreed to reach out to the Kremlin after Sater urged that Putin’s endorsement was needed ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=%2A%20Felix%20Sater%20Emails%3A%20Russia,Testimony%3B%20%E2%80%9CTrump%27s%20Moscow%20Tower%20and)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=Trump%20consistently%20told%20the%20public,question%20stands%20to%20gain%20financially)). Beyond business, Cohen was involved in political outreach: in 2016, he spoke with a Russian-American businessman who offered to broker a meeting between Trump and Putin, although this meeting did not happen ([Trump’s Conflicts of Interest in Russia - Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/trumps-conflicts-interest-russia/#:~:text=multiple%20investigations%20for%20his%20links,his%20highly%20unusual%20accounting)). During the transition, Cohen continued corresponding with a Kremlin-linked associate about a Russia-Ukraine peace plan (the so-called “back-channel Ukraine dossier” he later delivered to the White House) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=business%20in%20Russia%2C%E2%80%9D%20Cohen%20later,Channel%20Ukraine%20Dossier%E2%80%9D%20%28Just%20Security)). Cohen’s closeness to Trump meant that foreign intermediaries saw him as an access point – for instance, Cohen received a friendly contact from Putin’s personal spokesman in January 2016 responding to his inquiry about the Moscow project ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=business%20in%20Russia%2C%E2%80%9D%20Cohen%20later,Channel%20Ukraine%20Dossier%E2%80%9D%20%28Just%20Security)).  

**Financial, Criminal, and Political Connections:** Cohen’s legal issues became a major facet of the Trump-Russia saga. In 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to several federal crimes, including lying to Congress about the timeline of the Trump Tower Moscow talks ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=1)). He admitted that discussions actually continued into June 2016 (well into the presidential campaign), contrary to Trump’s public claims of “no Russia business” ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=Trump%20consistently%20told%20the%20public,question%20stands%20to%20gain%20financially)). Cohen also arranged hush-money payments to women alleging affairs with Trump, demonstrating his role in quashing potential scandals. Politically, Cohen was vice-chair of the Republican National Committee’s finance arm briefly in 2017, but his primary significance was as Trump’s fixer. His contacts with Russian officials or businessmen (like oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, who indirectly paid Cohen through a consulting contract in 2017) raised questions of potential quid pro quo ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,3)). Cohen cooperated extensively with Special Counsel Mueller and congressional investigators, providing testimony and documents that illuminated Trump’s business pursuits in Russia and other secret dealings ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=%2A%20Continued%20Negotiations%20Through%20Mid,Channel%20Ukraine%20Dossier%E2%80%9D%20%28Just%20Security)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=1)). In December 2018, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison, in part for the false statements to Congress about Russia ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=1)).  

**Role in the Network:** Cohen was a **key facilitator** of Trump’s Russia-related endeavors. Within any foreign influence network, he represented Trump’s interests directly to Russians, without official diplomatic oversight. By secretly negotiating a deal contingent on Kremlin approval while Trump ran for president, Cohen’s actions created a potential leverage point: the Russian government knew Trump’s organization sought its favor at the same time U.S. voters were deciding on Trump’s leadership ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=Trump%20consistently%20told%20the%20public,question%20stands%20to%20gain%20financially)). This dual role placed Cohen at the heart of possible compromises. Additionally, Cohen was involved in the campaign’s response to Russian interference allegations – he famously tried to pitch a “peace plan” to end Russia-Ukraine sanctions in early 2017, delivered from a pro-Russia Ukrainian politician ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=business%20in%20Russia%2C%E2%80%9D%20Cohen%20later,Channel%20Ukraine%20Dossier%E2%80%9D%20%28Just%20Security)). Though not charged with conspiracy, Cohen’s insider knowledge (shared in congressional hearings in February 2019) painted Trump as willingly working with people like Sater on Russian deals and revealed Trump’s personal awareness of WikiLeaks’ email dumps (Cohen testified that Trump seemed to know in advance about a WikiLeaks release) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,3)). Cohen thus ties many threads together: clandestine business negotiations, political cover-ups, and messaging shaped to benefit Trump while intersecting with Moscow’s interests.  

**Sources & Citations:** Michael Cohen’s involvement is documented through his own guilty plea and testimony. In his Senate and House testimony (2019), Cohen detailed the Trump Tower Moscow timeline and Trump’s knowledge ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=%2A%20Continued%20Negotiations%20Through%20Mid,Channel%20Ukraine%20Dossier%E2%80%9D%20%28Just%20Security)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=1)). The Mueller Report cites Cohen’s communications with Putin’s office and his false statements to Congress about ending the project in January 2016 (when it actually went to June) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=1)). Cohen’s July 2018 guilty plea (SDNY) outlines campaign-season payments and lying to Congress ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=1)). His interactions with Russian officials (emails to Peskov’s assistant, etc.) are described in Mueller’s court filings and were corroborated by phone records and emails ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=%2A%20Continued%20Negotiations%20Through%20Mid,Channel%20Ukraine%20Dossier%E2%80%9D%20%28Just%20Security)). Cohen’s House Oversight Committee hearing on Feb 27, 2019, provides a comprehensive first-person account of his role and includes exhibits like the signed Letter of Intent for Trump Tower Moscow. These records cement Cohen’s role as an indispensable witness and participant in Trump’s Russia dealings.

## Paul Manafort  
 ([image]()) *Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, speaking at the 2016 RNC (Voice of America footage) ([File:Paul Manafort at 2016 RNC.jpg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Paul_Manafort_at_2016_RNC.jpg#:~:text=Description%20Paul%20Manafort%20at%202016,jpg)).*  

**Background:** Paul Manafort (born 1949) is a veteran Republican consultant and lobbyist who became Trump’s campaign chairman in June 2016 ([Paul Manafort - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Manafort#:~:text=Paul%20Manafort%20,Bush%2C%20and%20Bob%20Dole)). Manafort had decades of experience advising politicians, including controversial foreign clients. Notably, from 2004–2010 he worked for pro-Russian Ukrainian Party of Regions and its leader Viktor Yanukovych, earning tens of millions which he concealed from U.S. authorities ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Roll%20Call)). He also had longstanding business ties to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, to whom he owed substantial debts by 2016 ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,identified%20later%20as%20a%20Russian)). Manafort’s personal finances were deeply entwined with Eastern Europe and he was known to maintain connections with individuals linked to Russian intelligence ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=politics.%20,Issues%20Final%20Report%20on%20Russian)). He joined the Trump campaign for free, which later raised questions given his past – a Senate report noted this created a “grave counterintelligence threat” ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Roll%20Call)).  

**Interactions with Trump:** As campaign chairman (June–August 2016), Manafort oversaw strategy and delegate wrangling. During this period, he had multiple interactions that drew scrutiny. In June 2016, he attended the Trump Tower meeting with the Russian lawyer offering dirt on Clinton, sitting alongside Donald Jr. and Kushner ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20most%20infamous,Russians%20promising%20damaging%20Clinton%20intel)). Throughout the campaign, Manafort was in contact with his long-time protégé Konstantin Kilimnik – a Ukraine-based political operative assessed by the FBI as tied to Russian intelligence ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=politics.%20,Issues%20Final%20Report%20on%20Russian)). Manafort met Kilimnik in person at least twice during the campaign (in May and August 2016) ([Paul Manafort - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Manafort#:~:text=Bush%2C%20and%20Bob%20Dole)). Critically, he shared internal polling data and strategic campaign updates with Kilimnik, expecting it to go to Deripaska (possibly as part of an effort to “clear up” his debts) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Roll%20Call)). In one secret August 2, 2016 meeting in New York, Manafort and Kilimnik discussed battleground state polling and a Russian-favored “peace plan” for Ukraine ([File : Face detail, Paul Manafort at 2016 RNC (cropped).jpg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Face_detail,_Paul_Manafort_at_2016_RNC_(cropped).jpg#:~:text=campaign%2C%20speaks%20with%20the%20media,man%20is%2C%20not%20just)) ([File:Paul Manafort at 2016 RNC.jpg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Paul_Manafort_at_2016_RNC.jpg#:~:text=File%3APaul%20Manafort%20at%202016%20RNC,the%20man%20is%2C%20not%20just)). Manafort’s tenure ended when his past lobbying for Ukraine (and a ledger showing alleged cash payments to him) became public, forcing his resignation in August 2016. However, even after leaving the campaign, Manafort remained in contact with Trump and others (he advised the transition informally).  

**Financial, Criminal, and Political Connections:** Manafort was later convicted of financial crimes (bank fraud, tax evasion) related to his Ukraine earnings, and he pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges in the Mueller probe ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,3)). These charges revealed he laundered over $30 million from his Ukraine lobbying and failed to register as a foreign agent ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Roll%20Call)). Politically, Manafort’s most consequential connections were to Russians and pro-Russian Ukrainians. Oleg Deripaska, a billionaire close to Putin, had hired Manafort years earlier; Manafort owed Deripaska nearly $20 million by 2016 ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,identified%20later%20as%20a%20Russian)). Emails show Manafort offered Deripaska “private briefings” on the campaign in July 2016 ([File:Paul Manafort at 2016 RNC.jpg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Paul_Manafort_at_2016_RNC.jpg#:~:text=English%3A%20Paul%20Manafort%2C%20then,the%20man%20is%2C%20not%20just)). Konstantin Kilimnik, who acted as liaison, was later indicted alongside Manafort for obstruction of justice (witness tampering) ([Accused Russiagate 'Spy' Kilimnik Speaks -- and Evidence Backs His 'No ...](https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2021/05/19/accused_russiagate_spy_kilimnik_speaks_-_and_evidence_backs_his_no_collusion_account_777328.html#:~:text=Accused%20Russiagate%20%27Spy%27%20Kilimnik%20Speaks,help%20nabbing%20Kilimnik%20on)). The Senate Intelligence Committee (2020) concluded that Manafort’s willingness to share information with Kilimnik represented a serious intelligence risk ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Roll%20Call)). During the campaign, Manafort also influenced platform changes favorable to Russia (e.g. softening language on arming Ukraine at the RNC) ([Russia connections in Trump's inner circle - apps.voxmedia.com](https://apps.voxmedia.com/graphics/vox-trump-russia-lawyers#:~:text=Trump%20Jr,Contacts%20with%20Russians)). 

**Role in the Network:** Manafort can be seen as a **key infiltrator** of Russian interests into the heart of the Trump campaign. Through Manafort’s contacts, the campaign unknowingly (or perhaps knowingly) provided Russia with inside information that could help tailor their influence operations ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=politics.%20,Roll%20Call)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=The%20bipartisan%20Senate%20Intelligence%20Committee,points%20for%20targeted%20influence%20operations)). His debts to a Putin-aligned oligarch and ongoing communications with a suspected Russian agent (Kilimnik) during 2016 suggest he had both motive and opportunity to serve foreign interests while leading Trump’s campaign ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Roll%20Call)). The bipartisan Senate report explicitly labeled Manafort’s relationship with Kilimnik a “grave counterintelligence threat” ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=intelligence%20officer.%20,Roll%20Call)). In essence, Manafort was the connecting hub between Trump’s camp and Russian political operatives. His role demonstrates how foreign leverage (through finances and past relationships) intersected with Trump’s political operation. Manafort’s willingness to trade campaign insights for potential debt relief or future profit aligns with the pattern of behavior one might expect if the campaign were being influenced or exploited by a foreign power ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Roll%20Call)) ([Paul Manafort - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Manafort#:~:text=Paul%20Manafort%20,Bush%2C%20and%20Bob%20Dole)). Even though Manafort never cooperated with investigators (he was later pardoned by Trump), the documentary evidence paints him as an active conduit for Russian influence during the campaign.  

**Sources & Citations:** Manafort’s activities are detailed in Mueller’s court filings and trial evidence. His sharing of polling data with Kilimnik is documented in Mueller’s report and was confirmed in a court transcript (a filed sentencing memo noted the August 2, 2016 cigar bar meeting and data transfer) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Roll%20Call)) ([Paul Manafort - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Manafort#:~:text=Bush%2C%20and%20Bob%20Dole)). The Senate Intelligence Committee’s final report (Vol. 5, Aug 2020) provides an exhaustive account of Manafort’s interactions with Kilimnik and Deripaska, concluding they posed a serious threat ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Roll%20Call)). Manafort’s indictment (Oct 2017) and trial (2018) exposed his Ukraine dealings ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Roll%20Call)). Emails from Manafort to Kilimnik (April 11, 2016) about giving Deripaska briefings were cited in press reports and Senate evidence ([File:Paul Manafort at 2016 RNC.jpg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Paul_Manafort_at_2016_RNC.jpg#:~:text=English%3A%20Paul%20Manafort%2C%20then,the%20man%20is%2C%20not%20just)). These sources collectively demonstrate Manafort’s pivotal role linking the Trump campaign to pro-Kremlin interests.

## Natalia Veselnitskaya  
**Background:** Natalia Veselnitskaya (born 1975) is a Russian lawyer known for her work against the Magnitsky Act – a 2012 U.S. sanctions law targeting Russian officials for human rights abuses ([Natalia Veselnitskaya - Courthouse News Service](https://www.courthousenews.com/natalia-veselnitskaya/#:~:text=Moscow%2C%20Russia,revelations%20about%20the%20meeting%20emerged)). Veselnitskaya’s clients included Denis Katsyv, a Russian businessman whose company was prosecuted for money laundering in the U.S. She was not an official government lawyer, but had connections in the Russian Prosecutor General’s office. In fact, in 2018 Veselnitskaya was charged by U.S. prosecutors with obstructing justice in an unrelated civil case, where she secretly cooperated with a senior Russian prosecutor to submit supposedly independent evidence ([Russian lawyer at heart of Trump Tower meeting charged with obstruction by New York prosecutors](https://www.vice.com/en/article/russian-lawyer-at-heart-of-trump-tower-meeting-charged-with-obstruction-by-new-york-prosecutors/#:~:text=before%20the%202016%20election%20just,charged%20with%20obstruction%20of%20justice)) ([Russian lawyer at heart of Trump Tower meeting charged with obstruction by New York prosecutors](https://www.vice.com/en/article/russian-lawyer-at-heart-of-trump-tower-meeting-charged-with-obstruction-by-new-york-prosecutors/#:~:text=Natalia%20Veselnitskaya%2C%20a%20lawyer%20from,fraud%20investigation%20into%20money%20laundering)). This blurred line between private lawyer and state agent is key to understanding her role. In June 2016, Veselnitskaya traveled to New York and became a central figure in what would become one of the most infamous episodes of the Trump campaign.  

**Interactions with Trump:** Veselnitskaya’s primary interaction with Trump’s circle was the June 9, 2016 Trump Tower meeting. Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort agreed to meet her after an intermediary (music publicist Rob Goldstone) indicated she would bring “official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary” as “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump” ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20most%20infamous,Russians%20promising%20damaging%20Clinton%20intel)) ([Trump Jr. says in emails he’d ‘love’ to see Russian info on Clinton](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-jr-says-emails-hed-love-see-russian-info-clinton#:~:text=Trump%20Jr,one%20response%2C%20Trump%20Jr)). At the meeting, however, Veselnitskaya did not present clear dirt on Clinton. Instead, by multiple accounts, she spoke about the Magnitsky Act sanctions and a Russian counter-measure (the ban on U.S. adoptions of Russian children) ([Natalia Veselnitskaya: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know](https://heavy.com/news/2017/07/natalia-veselnitskaya-donald-trump-jr-russian-lawyer-meeting-facebook-photos/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Natalia%20Veselnitskaya%2C%20Natalia%20Veselnitskaya,Veselnitskaya%20photos%2C%20Natalia%20Veselnitskaya%20pictures)) ([Natalia Veselnitskaya: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know](https://heavy.com/news/2017/07/natalia-veselnitskaya-donald-trump-jr-russian-lawyer-meeting-facebook-photos/#:~:text=Natalia%20Veselnitskaya%2C%20who%20was%20in,9%2C%202016%2C%20the%20Times%20reports)). She queried the Trump team on whether a future administration might lift those sanctions. Emails later showed Goldstone apologized to Trump Jr. that Veselnitskaya’s focus on adoption was “quite technical” and not the expected political bombshell ([Natalia Veselnitskaya: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know](https://heavy.com/news/2017/07/natalia-veselnitskaya-donald-trump-jr-russian-lawyer-meeting-facebook-photos/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Natalia%20Veselnitskaya%2C%20Natalia%20Veselnitskaya,Veselnitskaya%20photos%2C%20Natalia%20Veselnitskaya%20pictures)) ([Natalia Veselnitskaya: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know](https://heavy.com/news/2017/07/natalia-veselnitskaya-donald-trump-jr-russian-lawyer-meeting-facebook-photos/#:~:text=Natalia%20Veselnitskaya%2C%20who%20was%20in,9%2C%202016%2C%20the%20Times%20reports)). Nonetheless, the fact that the meeting happened – and that Veselnitskaya was characterized as delivering Russian government aid – is highly significant. Veselnitskaya also had a second brush with Trump associates: later in 2016, she met with Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (a congressman known for pro-Russia views) and discussed the sanctions issue, indicating her outreach in the U.S. went beyond just the Trump Tower encounter.  

**Financial, Criminal, and Political Connections:** Veselnitskaya’s anti-Magnitsky lobbying campaign in the U.S. was backed by powerful Russian interests. She worked closely with the Russian Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika’s office to spread a counter-narrative about the fraud exposed by Sergei Magnitsky ([Russian lawyer at heart of Trump Tower meeting charged with obstruction by New York prosecutors](https://www.vice.com/en/article/russian-lawyer-at-heart-of-trump-tower-meeting-charged-with-obstruction-by-new-york-prosecutors/#:~:text=before%20the%202016%20election%20just,charged%20with%20obstruction%20of%20justice)) ([Russian lawyer at heart of Trump Tower meeting charged with obstruction by New York prosecutors](https://www.vice.com/en/article/russian-lawyer-at-heart-of-trump-tower-meeting-charged-with-obstruction-by-new-york-prosecutors/#:~:text=Natalia%20Veselnitskaya%2C%20a%20lawyer%20from,fraud%20investigation%20into%20money%20laundering)). Politically, her mission was to persuade U.S. policymakers to repeal Magnitsky sanctions, which aligned with Kremlin objectives. The manner in which she gained entrance to Trump’s inner circle was through promises of campaign assistance – implying a quid pro quo of “dirt for sanctions relief.” Though she delivered no usable Clinton info, her ask was clear: consider repealing sanctions. U.S. intelligence later assessed that Veselnitskaya had ties to the Kremlin. In 2017, emails emerged showing she had collaborated with Chaika’s office on a document she brought to the Trump Tower meeting ([Russian lawyer at heart of Trump Tower meeting charged with obstruction by New York prosecutors](https://www.vice.com/en/article/russian-lawyer-at-heart-of-trump-tower-meeting-charged-with-obstruction-by-new-york-prosecutors/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Russian%20lawyer%20at%20heart,obstruction%20by%20New%20York%20prosecutors)) ([Russian lawyer who met with top Trump campaign officials says Mueller hasn't contacted her - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/23/natalia-veselnitskaya-mueller-investigation-545588#:~:text=Image%3A%20Natalia%20Veselnitskaya%20is%20pictured,Getty%20Images)). In 2018, the U.S. Attorney in New York charged her with submitting false declarations in the Katsyv case, revealing her surreptitious relationship with Russian officials ([Russian lawyer at heart of Trump Tower meeting charged with obstruction by New York prosecutors](https://www.vice.com/en/article/russian-lawyer-at-heart-of-trump-tower-meeting-charged-with-obstruction-by-new-york-prosecutors/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Russian%20lawyer%20at%20heart,obstruction%20by%20New%20York%20prosecutors)) ([Russian lawyer at heart of Trump Tower meeting charged with obstruction by New York prosecutors](https://www.vice.com/en/article/russian-lawyer-at-heart-of-trump-tower-meeting-charged-with-obstruction-by-new-york-prosecutors/#:~:text=before%20the%202016%20election%20just,charged%20with%20obstruction%20of%20justice)). She remained in Russia to avoid arrest. Financially, there’s no known direct exchange involving Veselnitskaya and Trump associates beyond information. However, her lobbying effort was funded by Katsyv’s organization and perhaps by the Russian state in-kind (through research and talking points). 

**Role in the Network:** Veselnitskaya functioned as a **messenger** of the Russian government’s interests, positioned to test the receptivity of Trump’s team to overtures of assistance. The June 2016 meeting is the clearest instance where Russian actors and Trump’s campaign intersected: Veselnitskaya, by offering “damaging information” on Clinton, effectively probed whether the campaign was open to conspiracy ([Natalia Veselnitskaya: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know](https://heavy.com/news/2017/07/natalia-veselnitskaya-donald-trump-jr-russian-lawyer-meeting-facebook-photos/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Natalia%20Veselnitskaya%2C%20Natalia%20Veselnitskaya,Veselnitskaya%20photos%2C%20Natalia%20Veselnitskaya%20pictures)) ([Trump Jr. says in emails he’d ‘love’ to see Russian info on Clinton](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-jr-says-emails-hed-love-see-russian-info-clinton#:~:text=Trump%20Jr,one%20response%2C%20Trump%20Jr)). The campaign’s decision to take that meeting – and Trump Jr.’s enthusiastic “I love it” – demonstrated willingness. Even though the meeting pivoted to sanctions, for the Russians it was an opportunity to directly convey what they wanted (repeal of Magnitsky sanctions) to Trump’s inner circle ([Natalia Veselnitskaya: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know](https://heavy.com/news/2017/07/natalia-veselnitskaya-donald-trump-jr-russian-lawyer-meeting-facebook-photos/#:~:text=Natalia%20Veselnitskaya%2C%20who%20was%20in,9%2C%202016%2C%20the%20Times%20reports)). In a potential influence network, Veselnitskaya sits at the interface of covert and overt operations: she ostensibly came offering opposition research (covert aid) and left lobbying about sanctions (overt policy discussion). In later analyses, officials noted that any acceptance of her help could be used by Russia as kompromat (to blackmail or pressure a President Trump). Thus, Veselnitskaya’s role is pivotal – she was the person through whom the Russian state arguably attempted to make contact and strike a bargain (dirt for policy) ([Natalia Veselnitskaya: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know](https://heavy.com/news/2017/07/natalia-veselnitskaya-donald-trump-jr-russian-lawyer-meeting-facebook-photos/#:~:text=Natalia%20Veselnitskaya%2C%20who%20was%20in,9%2C%202016%2C%20the%20Times%20reports)) ([Russian lawyer who met with top Trump campaign officials says Mueller hasn't contacted her - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/23/natalia-veselnitskaya-mueller-investigation-545588#:~:text=Image%3A%20Natalia%20Veselnitskaya%20is%20pictured,Getty%20Images)). 

**Sources & Citations:** The Trump Tower meeting has been exhaustively investigated. Veselnitskaya’s involvement is documented in emails released by Donald Trump Jr. and in testimony by participants ([Trump Jr. says in emails he’d ‘love’ to see Russian info on Clinton](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-jr-says-emails-hed-love-see-russian-info-clinton#:~:text=Trump%20Jr,one%20response%2C%20Trump%20Jr)) ([Natalia Veselnitskaya: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know](https://heavy.com/news/2017/07/natalia-veselnitskaya-donald-trump-jr-russian-lawyer-meeting-facebook-photos/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Natalia%20Veselnitskaya%2C%20Natalia%20Veselnitskaya,Veselnitskaya%20photos%2C%20Natalia%20Veselnitskaya%20pictures)). Veselnitskaya’s own statements (to the Senate Judiciary Committee in Nov 2017, and to media) confirm her focus on the Magnitsky Act. The Mueller Report recounts the meeting and notes Veselnitskaya’s connections to the Kremlin ([Russian lawyer who met with top Trump campaign officials says Mueller hasn't contacted her - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/23/natalia-veselnitskaya-mueller-investigation-545588#:~:text=Image%3A%20Natalia%20Veselnitskaya%20is%20pictured,Getty%20Images)). The April 2018 Politico piece cites how Mueller did not interview her but gathered evidence of her relationship with Chaika’s office ([Russian lawyer who met with top Trump campaign officials says Mueller hasn't contacted her - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/23/natalia-veselnitskaya-mueller-investigation-545588#:~:text=Image%3A%20Natalia%20Veselnitskaya%20is%20pictured,Getty%20Images)) ([Russian lawyer who met with top Trump campaign officials says Mueller hasn't contacted her - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/23/natalia-veselnitskaya-mueller-investigation-545588#:~:text=Natalia%20Veselnitskaya%20met%20in%20Trump,sourced%20from%20the%20Russian%20government)). Her 2018 U.S. indictment (unsealed Jan 2019) provides evidence of her collaboration with Russian officials ([Russian lawyer at heart of Trump Tower meeting charged with obstruction by New York prosecutors](https://www.vice.com/en/article/russian-lawyer-at-heart-of-trump-tower-meeting-charged-with-obstruction-by-new-york-prosecutors/#:~:text=before%20the%202016%20election%20just,charged%20with%20obstruction%20of%20justice)). Together, these sources establish that Veselnitskaya was not just a random private lawyer, but a figure operating with the support of, and in pursuit of goals aligned with, the Russian government.

## Rob Goldstone  
**Background:** Rob Goldstone (born 1960) is a British music publicist and former tabloid journalist. He represented Russian pop singer Emin Agalarov, the son of Azerbaijani-Russian oligarch Aras Agalarov. The Agalarovs had business and personal ties to Donald Trump from the Miss Universe 2013 pageant in Moscow (which Aras helped host and Emin performed at) ([The man who sent "the most famous email in history ... - Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/90276975/the-man-who-sent-the-most-famous-email-in-history-still-has-plenty-of-questions#:~:text=Company%20www,Agalarov%E2%80%99s%20father%2C%20Aras%2C%20a)). Goldstone’s connection to Trump world came via the Agalarovs. By 2016, Goldstone was living in the U.S. and, through Emin, had a direct line of communication to Trump’s circle. He is the person who emailed Donald Trump Jr. to set up the June 9, 2016 meeting, thus playing an instrumental yet behind-the-scenes role in the Russia saga.  

**Interactions with Trump:** Goldstone’s principal interaction was arranging the Trump Tower meeting. On June 3, 2016, he emailed Trump Jr. on Emin Agalarov’s behalf, conveying that a Russian prosecutor (Yuri Chaika) had offered Emin to provide the Trump campaign with official documents damaging to Hillary Clinton ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20most%20infamous,Russians%20promising%20damaging%20Clinton%20intel)) ([Trump Jr. email on potential Russian Hillary info: "I love it" - Axios](https://www.axios.com/2017/12/15/trump-jr-email-on-potential-russian-hillary-info-i-love-it-1513304115#:~:text=Trump%20Jr,of%20Russia%20and%20its)). Goldstone wrote this was “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” When Trump Jr. responded positively, Goldstone worked to coordinate a meeting, ultimately scheduling it for June 9 with Natalia Veselnitskaya as the “Russian government attorney” delivering the information ([Trump Jr. when a Russian lawyer offered dirt on Clinton: “I love it”](https://www.vice.com/en/article/here-are-donald-trump-jr-s-emails-with-a-kremlin-connected-lawyer/#:~:text=Trump%20Jr,his%20father%E2%80%99s%20former%20Russian)) ([Trump Jr. says in emails he’d ‘love’ to see Russian info on Clinton](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-jr-says-emails-hed-love-see-russian-info-clinton#:~:text=Trump%20Jr,one%20response%2C%20Trump%20Jr)). Goldstone met Trump Jr., Manafort, and Kushner at Trump Tower that day and brought Veselnitskaya (and her translator) up to the conference room. During the meeting, Goldstone mostly observed as Veselnitskaya spoke. Afterward, he apologized to Trump Jr. in an email that the intel was not more substantial ([Natalia Veselnitskaya: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know](https://heavy.com/news/2017/07/natalia-veselnitskaya-donald-trump-jr-russian-lawyer-meeting-facebook-photos/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Natalia%20Veselnitskaya%2C%20Natalia%20Veselnitskaya,Veselnitskaya%20photos%2C%20Natalia%20Veselnitskaya%20pictures)). Apart from this event, Goldstone had interacted with Trump previously during Miss Universe 2013 and an event at Trump Vegas in 2014 (he even posted photos with Trump). However, he was not a regular advisor or staff – his influence was unique to leveraging the Agalarov-Trump connection during the campaign. In interviews since, Goldstone has described himself as an unwilling participant who was simply forwarding a request from Emin and had hyped the “dirt” to get the meeting set ([Donald Trump Jr. replied ‘love it’ when told of Russian ... - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/11/donald-trump-jr-posts-email-chain-setting-up-meeting-with-russian-lawyer-240402#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%20Jr,information%20about%20Hillary%20Clinton)) ([Trump Jr. when a Russian lawyer offered dirt on Clinton: “I love it”](https://www.vice.com/en/article/here-are-donald-trump-jr-s-emails-with-a-kremlin-connected-lawyer/#:~:text=Trump%20Jr,his%20father%E2%80%99s%20former%20Russian)). 

**Financial, Criminal, and Political Connections:** Goldstone was not accused of any crime and cooperated with the Mueller investigation (he testified voluntarily to the grand jury). Financially, his motives were tied to keeping his client Emin Agalarov pleased – Emin and Aras hoped a friendly relationship with Trump (perhaps bolstered by helping his campaign) could lead to future business or political goodwill. Aras Agalarov had previously signed a preliminary deal with Trump to build a tower in Moscow (post-Miss Universe) that never came to fruition; they clearly remained interested in a Trump partnership. Politically, Goldstone had no agenda of his own, but he became a conduit for a foreign government’s outreach to a U.S. campaign. His emails are a rare instance of written evidence explicitly referencing Russian government support for Trump ([Trump Jr. email on potential Russian Hillary info: "I love it" - Axios](https://www.axios.com/2017/12/15/trump-jr-email-on-potential-russian-hillary-info-i-love-it-1513304115#:~:text=Trump%20Jr,of%20Russia%20and%20its)) ([Trump Jr. says in emails he’d ‘love’ to see Russian info on Clinton](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-jr-says-emails-hed-love-see-russian-info-clinton#:~:text=Trump%20Jr,one%20response%2C%20Trump%20Jr)). This made Goldstone, in hindsight, a key figure in the narrative of potential collusion. He has since claimed he used “publicist puff” in that email, but the fact remains he conveyed what his Russian contacts wanted: a meeting of minds. Goldstone’s casual role – neither U.S. nor Russian official – was politically useful as a deniable intermediary.  

**Role in the Network:** In the influence network, Rob Goldstone served as a **connector** linking Russian interests (the Agalarovs and Veselnitskaya/Chaika) with the Trump campaign. He leveraged personal relationships rather than any formal position. By reaching out to Trump Jr., Goldstone set in motion the most direct interaction between Team Trump and Kremlin-linked figures during the campaign ([Trump Jr. email on potential Russian Hillary info: "I love it" - Axios](https://www.axios.com/2017/12/15/trump-jr-email-on-potential-russian-hillary-info-i-love-it-1513304115#:~:text=Trump%20Jr,of%20Russia%20and%20its)). Essentially, Goldstone opened a backchannel: his email bypassed normal diplomatic or official routes and went straight to the candidate’s family, offering clandestine assistance. Within days, this resulted in senior campaign officials sitting down with a Russian emissary. Goldstone’s actions illustrate how informal networks (business/celebrity ties from Miss Universe) were repurposed for political aims ([The man who sent "the most famous email in history ... - Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/90276975/the-man-who-sent-the-most-famous-email-in-history-still-has-plenty-of-questions#:~:text=Company%20www,Agalarov%E2%80%99s%20father%2C%20Aras%2C%20a)) ([Who is Rob Goldstone, the eccentric British man who ... - The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/rob-goldstone-trump-jr-russia-lawyer-meeting-natalia-veselnitskaya-a7836331.html#:~:text=Independent%20www,a%20flair%20for%20the%20eccentric)). After the fact, when the meeting became public in July 2017, Goldstone’s email chain was published by Trump Jr., confirming the approach. As such, Goldstone is a critical facilitator whose willingness to “make the introduction” allowed an overture that could be construed as part of a collaboration. His role shows that a foreign influence effort need not start with spies or cut-outs – it can begin with a music promoter emailing “Would you like some dirt?” and an eager reply from the candidate’s son ([Trump Jr. email on potential Russian Hillary info: "I love it" - Axios](https://www.axios.com/2017/12/15/trump-jr-email-on-potential-russian-hillary-info-i-love-it-1513304115#:~:text=Trump%20Jr,of%20Russia%20and%20its)). 

**Sources & Citations:** The primary evidence of Goldstone’s role is the email correspondence he initiated, which Donald Trump Jr. publicly released on Twitter on July 11, 2017 ([Donald Trump Jr Email on Russian Offer of Hillary Clinton Dirt: 'I Love ...](https://www.thewrap.com/donald-trump-jr-email-russian-offer-hillary-clinton-dirt-love/#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%20Jr%20Email%20on,the%20text%20of%20the%20emails)) ([Trump Jr. email on potential Russian Hillary info: "I love it" - Axios](https://www.axios.com/2017/12/15/trump-jr-email-on-potential-russian-hillary-info-i-love-it-1513304115#:~:text=Trump%20Jr,of%20Russia%20and%20its)). These emails are also summarized in Mueller’s report and Senate reports. Goldstone gave an extensive interview to the Senate Intelligence Committee in December 2017 and has spoken publicly (including an autobiography) detailing how the meeting came about. Media coverage (e.g. **The New York Times**, July 2017) first revealed Goldstone’s involvement, quoting the explosive phrases from his emails. The Atlantic and Axios have published the full text of the “Russia – Clinton” email chain ([Trump Jr. email on potential Russian Hillary info: "I love it" - Axios](https://www.axios.com/2017/12/15/trump-jr-email-on-potential-russian-hillary-info-i-love-it-1513304115#:~:text=to%20procure%20damaging%20information%20about,of%20Russia%20and%20its)) ([Trump Jr. says in emails he’d ‘love’ to see Russian info on Clinton](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-jr-says-emails-hed-love-see-russian-info-clinton#:~:text=Trump%20Jr,one%20response%2C%20Trump%20Jr)). All accounts underscore Goldstone’s unusual but pivotal part in connecting the dots between Moscow and Trump Tower.

## Oleg Deripaska  
 ([File:Oleg Deripaska.jpg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Oleg_Deripaska.jpg)) *Oleg Deripaska, Russian oligarch and one-time Manafort patron, at the World Economic Forum.*  

**Background:** Oleg Deripaska (born 1968) is a Russian industrialist often described as a **Kremlin-aligned oligarch**. He founded Rusal, one of the world’s largest aluminum companies, and became one of Russia’s richest men. Deripaska has longstanding close ties to Vladimir Putin; in 2013 he was even honored with Russia’s Order of Friendship ([Oleg Deripaska - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleg_Deripaska#:~:text=smelter%20from%20a%20consortium%20of,who%20privatized%20it%20in)). U.S. diplomatic cables have described him as among the oligarchs who are “proxies” for the Russian state’s projects. Crucially, Deripaska had a prior business relationship with Paul Manafort: around 2006–2009, Manafort worked for Deripaska on ventures in Eastern Europe, and Deripaska invested in Manafort’s funds. By 2016, Deripaska and Manafort were embroiled in a financial dispute – Manafort allegedly owed Deripaska around $19 million ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,identified%20later%20as%20a%20Russian)). This connection positioned Deripaska as a possible channel for influence: Manafort’s debt potentially gave Deripaska leverage, and Manafort knew Deripaska could directly reach top Kremlin officials. Indeed, Deripaska is known to be very close to Putin and involved in Putin’s geopolitical agenda (such as Russian influence in Ukraine). The U.S. sanctioned Deripaska in 2018 for acting on behalf of the Russian government.  

**Interactions with Trump:** Deripaska did not interact with Trump personally, but his shadow loomed over the campaign through Manafort. In July 2016, while serving as campaign chairman, Manafort instructed an associate to offer Deripaska private briefings on the campaign ([File:Paul Manafort at 2016 RNC.jpg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Paul_Manafort_at_2016_RNC.jpg#:~:text=File%3APaul%20Manafort%20at%202016%20RNC,the%20man%20is%2C%20not%20just)). Emails to Deripaska’s aide said such briefings would be “on how the Trump campaign was doing,” an offer Manafort’s team made shortly after Trump secured the GOP nomination. It is not publicly known if Deripaska received any briefing, but the outreach itself is significant ([File:Paul Manafort at 2016 RNC.jpg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Paul_Manafort_at_2016_RNC.jpg#:~:text=English%3A%20Paul%20Manafort%2C%20then,the%20man%20is%2C%20not%20just)). Separately, Deripaska was indirectly involved in the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting story: the Russian lawyer Veselnitskaya brought to that meeting had earlier worked with a lobbying group (co-founded by Fusion GPS) that was paid by Katsyv, and Katsyv’s funding reportedly came via an entity connected to… Deripaska (showing how oligarchs’ money can fuel influence campaigns). Moreover, when news of Russian election interference broke in early 2017, Deripaska penned an odd op-ed in The **Wall Street Journal** claiming he was a victim of “fake news” linking him to meddling – a proactive attempt to distance himself as investigations ramped up. In essence, Deripaska’s direct “interaction” with Trump’s world was through **Manafort’s indebtedness** and Manafort’s sharing of internal data that likely reached Deripaska’s hands via Konstantin Kilimnik ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Roll%20Call)). Kilimnik flew to Moscow frequently and met Deripaska; the Senate report strongly suggests Kilimnik passed along the campaign information Manafort gave him in August 2016 to Deripaska ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=politics.%20,Roll%20Call)) ([Paul Manafort - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Manafort#:~:text=Bush%2C%20and%20Bob%20Dole)). 

**Financial, Criminal, and Political Connections:** Deripaska epitomizes the nexus of money and politics in Putin’s Russia. He has been involved in controversial dealings globally and has been denied entry to the U.S. in the past over organized crime concerns ([Felix Sater - The Moscow Project](https://themoscowproject.org/players/felixsater/index.html#:~:text=Felix%20Sater%20,fraud%20scheme)). Financially, his ties to Manafort run deep – Manafort’s work in Ukraine was effectively underwritten by Deripaska (one deal Manafort pitched was a multi-million investment fund with Deripaska as sole investor). That deal soured by 2014, leaving Manafort in serious debt to him ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,identified%20later%20as%20a%20Russian)). Politically, Deripaska often undertakes projects beneficial to the Kremlin. During the 2016 campaign, he would have stood to gain if a Trump Administration lifted U.S. sanctions (Deripaska was reportedly on an internal Kremlin list in 2016 of oligarchs to lobby for sanctions relief). In 2018, the U.S. finally sanctioned Deripaska for Russia’s malign activities, calling him part of Putin’s “global malign activity” network. Interestingly, in 2019 the Trump Treasury Department lifted sanctions on Deripaska’s companies (after he agreed to reduce his ownership), a decision that was controversial in Congress. Intelligence-wise, Deripaska has been on FBI’s radar for years; according to reports, the FBI even tried to recruit him as an informant around 2014, unsuccessfully. Deripaska was not charged in the Mueller probe, but the Senate Intelligence Committee portrayed him as a vital piece of the puzzle – the one Manafort intended to please by providing insider info ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=politics.%20,Roll%20Call)). 

**Role in the Network:** Deripaska serves as a **power broker** linking Russian state interests with individuals in Trump’s orbit. If one imagines the influence web, Deripaska is at the Russian end, with tentacles extending outward through money and favors. Through Manafort, Deripaska potentially had a direct line into the Trump campaign’s strategy and polling ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Roll%20Call)). The incentive for him was twofold: financial (recoup his money or gain an advantageous position if Manafort rose in power) and political (use Manafort to advance Kremlin-favored policies). Deripaska’s closeness to Putin means that any information he gleaned from Manafort could conceivably have been shared with the highest levels of the Russian government. Thus, Deripaska can be seen as a proxy through which the Kremlin might exploit Manafort’s access. The Senate report explicitly states Manafort’s interaction with Kilimnik (and by extension Deripaska) constituted a serious threat to U.S. interests ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=intelligence%20officer.%20,Roll%20Call)). In summary, Deripaska was a central figure on the Russian side who stood to benefit from a Trump presidency and whose associates actively engaged with Trump’s campaign manager during the election.  

**Sources & Citations:** Deripaska’s relationship with Manafort is documented in Manafort’s own ledgers and emails (seized by investigators) and discussed in Mueller’s court filings ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Roll%20Call)). The offer of campaign briefings was revealed in press reports (WaPo, Dec 2017) and confirmed in the Senate Intelligence Committee findings ([File:Paul Manafort at 2016 RNC.jpg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Paul_Manafort_at_2016_RNC.jpg#:~:text=File%3APaul%20Manafort%20at%202016%20RNC,the%20man%20is%2C%20not%20just)). The Senate report provides detailed context on Deripaska, noting his ties to Russian intelligence and describing Kilimnik as a “cutout” for Deripaska in communicating with Manafort ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=politics.%20,Roll%20Call)). U.S. Treasury sanction announcements (April 6, 2018) outline Deripaska’s activities and reasons for sanctioning him. Congressional records from 2018-2019 (when Congress reviewed the deal lifting some sanctions on his companies) further illuminate his influence. These sources collectively underscore Deripaska’s importance in the Trump-Russia narrative as the oligarch with one foot in Putin’s inner circle and another reaching Trump’s campaign through Manafort.

## Konstantin Kilimnik  
**Background:** Konstantin Kilimnik (born 1970) is a Russian-Ukrainian political operative who worked closely with Paul Manafort for over a decade. Fluent in English and with a background in linguistics, Kilimnik was Manafort’s Kiev office manager during Manafort’s consulting for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. U.S. investigators determined that Kilimnik had ties to Russian military intelligence (the GRU) – the FBI assessed him as an active Russian **intelligence asset** in 2016 ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=politics.%20,Roll%20Call)). Kilimnik had served in the Soviet Army as a translator and later reportedly worked for the GRU. By 2016, he was a key liaison between Manafort and Russian/Ukrainian interests. He traveled regularly to Moscow and maintained relationships with Russian oligarchs like Oleg Deripaska. In short, Kilimnik occupied an unusual space: simultaneously the right-hand man to Trump’s campaign chairman and a presumed agent of Kremlin intelligence.  

**Interactions with Trump:** Kilimnik’s interactions with Trump himself are not documented, but his interactions with Trump’s campaign through Manafort were extensive and highly consequential. During 2016, Manafort communicated with Kilimnik via emails and WhatsApp and met in person. The most significant meeting occurred on August 2, 2016, at the Grand Havana Room in New York City ([Paul Manafort - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Manafort#:~:text=Bush%2C%20and%20Bob%20Dole)). There, Manafort and his deputy Rick Gates met Kilimnik to discuss the campaign’s internal polling data and their strategy in battleground states ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=politics.%20,Roll%20Call)). Manafort handed Kilimnik detailed polling and messaging insights, which Kilimnik later flew to Moscow with ([File : Face detail, Paul Manafort at 2016 RNC (cropped).jpg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Face_detail,_Paul_Manafort_at_2016_RNC_(cropped).jpg#:~:text=campaign%2C%20speaks%20with%20the%20media,man%20is%2C%20not%20just)) ([Paul Manafort - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Manafort#:~:text=Bush%2C%20and%20Bob%20Dole)). Also on the agenda was a Ukraine peace plan that would benefit Russia (essentially recognizing Russia’s annexation of Crimea in exchange for peace in eastern Ukraine) ([Paul Manafort - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Manafort#:~:text=Paul%20Manafort%20,Bush%2C%20and%20Bob%20Dole)). Earlier, in May 2016, Manafort met Kilimnik in person as well, likely also discussing campaign matters. Throughout the campaign, Gates (Manafort’s aide) continued feeding Kilimnik updates at Manafort’s direction ([Trump campaign’s Russia contacts ‘grave’ threat, Senate says](https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-international-news-elections-politics-campaigns-5e833a62e9492f6a66624b7920cc846a#:~:text=Trump%20campaign%E2%80%99s%20Russia%20contacts%20%E2%80%98grave%E2%80%99,officer%20and%20that%20other)) ([INTERACTIVE: 100+ Contacts Between the Trump Campaign and Russia](https://themoscowproject.org/dispatch/interactive-100-contacts-between-the-trump-campaign-and-russia/index.html#:~:text=As%20a%20result%20of%20an,linked%20figures%20above)). Notably, in July 2016, after the Republican convention, Kilimnik emailed Manafort congratulations and mentioned Deripaska – hinting about making Manafort “whole” (which investigators interpreted as Manafort perhaps using his position to resolve the debt to Deripaska) ([File:Paul Manafort at 2016 RNC.jpg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Paul_Manafort_at_2016_RNC.jpg#:~:text=File%3APaul%20Manafort%20at%202016%20RNC,the%20man%20is%2C%20not%20just)). Kilimnik remained in touch after Manafort’s resignation; he met Manafort again in Madrid in early 2017 while Manafort was advising Trump’s transition (this came out during Manafort’s trial). In 2018, Special Counsel Mueller indicted Kilimnik (alongside Manafort) for obstruction of justice, accusing them of tampering with witnesses about the lobbying they did in Ukraine ([Accused Russiagate 'Spy' Kilimnik Speaks -- and Evidence Backs His 'No ...](https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2021/05/19/accused_russiagate_spy_kilimnik_speaks_-_and_evidence_backs_his_no_collusion_account_777328.html#:~:text=Accused%20Russiagate%20%27Spy%27%20Kilimnik%20Speaks,help%20nabbing%20Kilimnik%20on)). Kilimnik, however, stayed in Moscow – beyond reach of U.S. law enforcement – and thus never faced trial. 

**Financial, Criminal, and Political Connections:** Kilimnik is a nexus of Russian intelligence and oligarch connections. Politically, he was deeply involved in shaping Ukrainian politics to Moscow’s liking. Criminally, he became a fugitive from U.S. justice after Mueller’s indictment ([Accused Russiagate 'Spy' Kilimnik Speaks -- and Evidence Backs His 'No ...](https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2021/05/19/accused_russiagate_spy_kilimnik_speaks_-_and_evidence_backs_his_no_collusion_account_777328.html#:~:text=Accused%20Russiagate%20%27Spy%27%20Kilimnik%20Speaks,help%20nabbing%20Kilimnik%20on)). The FBI also placed him on their “Most Wanted” list in 2020, with a $250,000 reward for information leading to his arrest ([Accused Russiagate 'Spy' Kilimnik Speaks -- and Evidence Backs His 'No ...](https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2021/05/19/accused_russiagate_spy_kilimnik_speaks_-_and_evidence_backs_his_no_collusion_account_777328.html#:~:text=The%20FBI%27s%20alert%20was%20also,help%20nabbing%20Kilimnik%20on)) ([](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/counterintelligence/konstantin-viktorovich-kilimnik/konstantin-viktorovich-kilimnik.pdf#:~:text=CAUTION%20Konstantin%20Viktorovich%20Kilimnik%20is,liaison%20to%20Ukrainian%20and%20Russian)). Financial ties: Kilimnik was reportedly paid by Manafort (with funds ultimately from Deripaska and Ukrainian clients). In 2017, he reportedly also received payments from Deripaska’s businesses. During the campaign, Kilimnik’s agenda was aligned with Deripaska’s (he communicated Deripaska’s messages to Manafort like, “Oleg is looking for you”). Politically, his August 2016 meeting with Manafort is seen as a potential handoff of valuable data to Russian intelligence, which could have aided Russia’s targeted interference (e.g. guiding propaganda or hacking efforts to key districts) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=intelligence%20officer.%20,Roll%20Call)). U.S. Treasury in 2021 went as far as to say Kilimnik “provided the Russian Intelligence Services with sensitive information on polling and campaign strategy” from the Trump campaign ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=politics.%20,Roll%20Call)) – a bombshell statement implying the data Manafort shared did indeed reach Russian intelligence. This underscores how Kilimnik functioned: as an intermediary funneling information between the Trump campaign and Russian actors, presumably including the GRU (which was at the same time hacking and leaking Democratic emails). 

**Role in the Network:** Kilimnik is arguably the most direct **bridge** between Trump’s campaign and Russian intelligence. In a hypothetical espionage diagram, he’d be the point where lines from Manafort connect to lines toward the GRU/Deripaska/Putin. The Senate Intelligence Committee bluntly stated that Kilimnik’s involvement “represented a grave counterintelligence threat” due to his intelligence ties and access to the campaign’s inner workings ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=intelligence%20officer.%20,Roll%20Call)). Unlike the higher-profile public figures, Kilimnik operated in the shadows – meeting privately, communicating via encrypted apps, and disappearing to Moscow when scrutiny arose. If one were examining the “Manchurian Candidate” hypothesis, Kilimnik’s successful cultivation of Manafort would be exhibit A: through Manafort, Kilimnik obtained confidential campaign data and influenced discussion of policies (like the Ukraine peace plan) that aligned with Moscow’s interests ([Paul Manafort - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Manafort#:~:text=Paul%20Manafort%20,Bush%2C%20and%20Bob%20Dole)). Post-election, Kilimnik’s proposal for a peace plan (delivered to the Trump State Department via an intermediary) was an attempt to cash in on that access. Though Kilimnik never made headlines like other figures, the information he passed along and the plans he pushed were potentially very damaging to U.S. interests and beneficial to Russia. 

**Sources & Citations:** The Mueller Report and related court filings provide substantial detail on Kilimnik. A partially redacted Mueller filing (Jan 2019) accidentally revealed that Manafort admitted to sharing polling data with Kilimnik ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=politics.%20,Roll%20Call)). The Treasury Department’s 2021 announcement (press release on new sanctions) explicitly noted Kilimnik’s role in providing campaign data to Russian intelligence ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=intelligence%20officer.%20,Roll%20Call)). The Senate Intelligence Committee’s Volume 5 (Aug 2020) devotes an entire section to Manafort and Kilimnik, citing communications and testimony from Gates, and concludes Kilimnik likely was connected to the GRU’s hack-and-leak operations ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=politics.%20,Roll%20Call)). FBI special agent exhibits from Manafort’s trial (2018) also include email exchanges showing Kilimnik acting as go-between for Manafort and Deripaska ([File:Paul Manafort at 2016 RNC.jpg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Paul_Manafort_at_2016_RNC.jpg#:~:text=File%3APaul%20Manafort%20at%202016%20RNC,the%20man%20is%2C%20not%20just)). Finally, the FBI’s “Most Wanted” poster for Kilimnik (June 2020) summarizes the obstruction charges and his biographical details ([](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/counterintelligence/konstantin-viktorovich-kilimnik/konstantin-viktorovich-kilimnik.pdf#:~:text=CAUTION%20Konstantin%20Viktorovich%20Kilimnik%20is,liaison%20to%20Ukrainian%20and%20Russian)) ([](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/counterintelligence/konstantin-viktorovich-kilimnik/konstantin-viktorovich-kilimnik.pdf#:~:text=to%20Russian%20Intelligence%2C%20allegedly%20assisted,CONSIDERED%20AN%20INTERNATIONAL%20FLIGHT%20RISK)). These collective sources underscore Kilimnik’s central (if covert) role in the Trump-Russia affair.

## George Papadopoulos  
**Background:** George Papadopoulos (born 1987) was a little-known energy consultant who became a foreign policy advisor to Trump’s campaign in March 2016. Young and ambitious, Papadopoulos had previously worked with a London-based think tank and briefly on Ben Carson’s presidential campaign. The Trump campaign listed him as one of five foreign policy advisors, and he focused on U.S.-Russia relations. Importantly, Papadopoulos moved to London during the campaign, where he cultivated contacts who claimed high-level Russian connections ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Russian%20intelligence%20to%20recruit%20him)). His lack of experience did not stop him from trying to broker a summit between Trump and Putin.  

**Interactions with Trump:** Papadopoulos had limited direct interaction with Trump (aside from a March 2016 meeting where Trump and Jeff Sessions were present and Papadopoulos pitched the idea of a meeting with Putin), but he interacted extensively with other campaign officials and intermediaries regarding Russia. In April 2016, while in London, Papadopoulos met a professor named Joseph Mifsud, who introduced him to a woman falsely presented as “Putin’s niece” and to a Russian MFA (Ministry of Foreign Affairs) contact ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Russian%20intelligence%20to%20recruit%20him)). On April 26, 2016, Mifsud told Papadopoulos that the Russians had “thousands of emails” with dirt on Hillary Clinton – this was weeks before the Clinton campaign even knew it had been hacked ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Russian%20intelligence%20to%20recruit%20him)). Papadopoulos eagerly passed this information along to at least one senior campaign official. In May 2016, Papadopoulos told an Australian diplomat in London about the “Russian dirt” offer; when DNC emails began leaking in July, the Australians alerted the U.S., making Papadopoulos’s boast the trigger for the FBI’s “Crossfire Hurricane” investigation ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Russian%20intelligence%20to%20recruit%20him)). Papadopoulos also kept pushing for a Trump-Putin meeting. He emailed Manafort and others about his Russian contacts’ proposal for a meeting in neutral locations and even suggested Trump travel to Moscow. While Manafort and co-chairman Sam Clovis expressed caution or deferred the idea, they did not shut Papadopoulos down entirely. Papadopoulos continued communications with his Russian contacts (MFA officials) through summer 2016 about potential meetings, at one point receiving an email: “We are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with Mr. Trump” (from a Russian diplomat) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Russian%20intelligence%20to%20recruit%20him)). Ultimately, no summit occurred pre-election, but Papadopoulos remained in contact with the Russians into October 2016.  

**Financial, Criminal, and Political Connections:** Papadopoulos’s role became one of the earliest criminal cases in the Mueller probe. He was arrested in July 2017 and pleaded guilty in October 2017 to making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with Mifsud and the Russians ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Russian%20intelligence%20to%20recruit%20him)). Politically, Papadopoulos was a minor figure, but his actions had major consequences. He had no significant financial ties to Russia; his motivations seemed to be career advancement and impressing the campaign. Yet, by dangling the prospect of Russian help (the stolen Clinton emails) and a Putin meeting, Papadopoulos injected the possibility of collusion into the campaign’s bloodstream. The campaign did not discipline him – in fact, Trump continued to mention Papadopoulos as an adviser through the election (even citing him in a Washington Post interview as an “excellent guy”). After his cooperation and guilty plea, Papadopoulos served a brief 14-day sentence. He later portrayed himself as a victim of a setup, though evidence clearly showed he sought to leverage Russian connections. 

**Role in the Network:** Papadopoulos served as an **origin point** in the chain of events linking Trump’s campaign to Russian intel about Clinton. He was the first Trump associate known to have been told about the Kremlin possessing Democratic emails months before they were public ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Russian%20intelligence%20to%20recruit%20him)). That positioned him – whether he realized it fully or not – as a conduit of valuable intelligence. Had the campaign followed up on his information or overtures more aggressively, the coordination might have been more overt. From a counterintelligence perspective, Papadopoulos was a prime target for Russian influence: young, inexperienced, and eager to ingratiate himself. Mifsud (and possibly others) fed him tantalizing information which he then transmitted into the Trump camp ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Russian%20intelligence%20to%20recruit%20him)). Thus, Papadopoulos was a vector through which the Russians tested the campaign’s receptiveness. His enthusiastic pursuit of a Putin meeting also signaled to Moscow that the Trump team was open to cooperation. In the context of assessing a “hidden agenda,” Papadopoulos’s story shows the campaign’s openness – short of an outright deal – to exploring Russian assistance ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Just%20Security)). The Mueller Report concluded Papadopoulos’s efforts were indeed a spark that led to the FBI investigation ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Russian%20intelligence%20to%20recruit%20him)). In sum, he’s a peripheral but pivotal member of Trump’s network who acted (wittingly or not) as a middle-man between Russian intermediaries and the official campaign.  

**Sources & Citations:** Papadopoulos’s saga is outlined in his Statement of Offense (October 5, 2017) which details his interactions with Mifsud and others ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Russian%20intelligence%20to%20recruit%20him)). The Mueller Report further elaborates on his communications and the campaign’s internal emails responding to his proposals ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Just)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Just%20Security)). Notably, an email from Manafort to Gates on May 21, 2016, referencing Papadopoulos’s Putin-meeting idea, stated “We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips” but also added, “It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal” – which is telling of how they wanted to manage Papadopoulos’s outreach ([Russia connections in Trump's inner circle - apps.voxmedia.com](https://apps.voxmedia.com/graphics/vox-trump-russia-lawyers#:~:text=Trump%20Jr,Contacts%20with%20Russians)). Contemporary news articles (e.g. **New York Times**, Dec 2017) and the FBI affidavit for his arrest fill in narrative gaps. Finally, Papadopoulos’s own memoir (2019) provides his personal (though self-serving) account of these events. All sources converge on the fact that Papadopoulos learned of Russia’s email trove in April 2016 and that this intelligence was effectively Russia’s first overture to the campaign ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Russian%20intelligence%20to%20recruit%20him)).

## Carter Page  
**Background:** Carter Page (born 1971) is an energy consultant who became a foreign policy advisor to the Trump campaign in March 2016, similarly to Papadopoulos. Page had lived and worked in Moscow in the early 2000s as an investment banker and remained an outspoken admirer of Vladimir Putin. Prior to joining Trump, Page was on the FBI’s radar: A 2013 FBI investigation into a Russian spy ring in New York revealed one spy attempted to recruit Page, describing him as an “idiot” but useful for information ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=%28Politico%29%20www.politico.eu%20%20,Russian%20intelligence%20to%20recruit%20him)). Page was never charged and claimed he wasn’t aware the individuals were Russian agents. By 2016, he openly advocated pro-Russia views, criticizing U.S. sanctions and NATO expansions. His lack of government experience was offset by his eagerness to engage with Russia, which is likely why the Trump campaign included him as an advisor.  

**Interactions with Trump:** Page had minimal direct contact with Trump (he never met Trump one-on-one during the campaign). His value to the campaign was as a surrogate who could interface with Russians. In July 2016, Page traveled to Moscow with the campaign’s approval to give a speech at a university ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=%28Politico%29%20www.politico.eu%20%20,Russian%20intelligence%20to%20recruit%20him)). While there, he met with Russian officials – reportedly including Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich – and executives from Rosneft, a state-owned oil giant ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=%28Politico%29%20www.politico.eu%20%20,Russian%20intelligence%20to%20recruit%20him)). According to Page (and confirmed by Dvorkovich), Dvorkovich greeted him briefly and expressed positive sentiments about Trump. The infamous (though unverified) Steele Dossier alleged that during this trip, Page met Rosneft’s CEO Igor Sechin and was offered brokerage fees on a sale of Rosneft stock in exchange for future sanctions relief. Page has denied this meeting, and no evidence corroborating the dossier’s specific claims has emerged publicly. However, U.S. intelligence did detect Page’s contacts: The FBI obtained a FISA surveillance warrant on Page in October 2016 on the basis he might be an agent of Russia ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=%28Politico%29%20www.politico.eu%20%20,Russian%20intelligence%20to%20recruit%20him)). During the campaign, Page also kept communication with Trump officials. After returning from Moscow, he emailed the campaign about “incredible insights” from Russian lawmakers and hoped to brief them more ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=%28Politico%29%20www.politico.eu%20%20,Russian%20intelligence%20to%20recruit%20him)). He remained on the campaign until September 2016, when media scrutiny about his Moscow trip and past Russian contacts prompted him to leave.  

**Financial, Criminal, and Political Connections:** Page was never charged with a crime in the Russia probe. The Mueller Report ultimately found insufficient evidence that Page conspired with Russia. Yet, politically, his activities were significant enough to warrant investigation. Financially, Page had some business interests in Russia – he sought deals in the energy sector, though nothing huge materialized. He was at one point working on a potential investment deal involving Gazprom (the large Russian gas company) and touted owning shares of Gazprom stock himself. These interests aligned him with a pro-Kremlin perspective on energy policy. Page’s prior interactions with Russian intelligence (in 2013, he provided documents on the energy sector to a man later exposed as a Russian agent) underscored that Moscow had identified him as a potential asset ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=%28Politico%29%20www.politico.eu%20%20,Russian%20intelligence%20to%20recruit%20him)). Politically, by advocating easing of Russia sanctions and denying Russian intervention in Ukraine, Page’s policy positions meshed with Putin’s. His role in the campaign was informal, but he was publicly identified enough that when the Republican convention altered the Ukraine plank (softening support for arming Ukraine against separatists), reporters speculated about involvement by advisors like Page.  

**Role in the Network:** Carter Page served as an **entry point** for Russian outreach to the campaign, but perhaps more on the policy influence side than covert information trading. His trip to Moscow was a signal the Trump campaign was open to dialogue. Russian officials who met Page likely used him to send messages back to Trump’s team (e.g., indicating Russia’s preference for Trump). If Papadopoulos was one conduit for information (Clinton emails), Page was a conduit for policy signals (sanctions, energy cooperation). The FBI’s surveillance of Page throughout late 2016 and into 2017 suggests they viewed him as a potential espionage risk ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=%28Politico%29%20www.politico.eu%20%20,Russian%20intelligence%20to%20recruit%20him)). In a broader influence network, Page was an accessible figure: not high-ranking, but with enough campaign stature to credibly communicate with Russian officials on Trump’s behalf. Moscow could use Page to gauge the campaign’s stances and perhaps entice the campaign with economic deals (as the Steele Dossier alleged with Rosneft). While much of the dossier’s material on Page remains unverified, what is established is that Page’s presence in Moscow during the campaign was known to Russian authorities and coincided with their interference efforts. Thus, he is a piece of the puzzle illustrating the Trump campaign’s unusual openness to Russian contacts ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=%28Politico%29%20www.politico.eu%20%20,Just%20Security)). 

**Sources & Citations:** Carter Page’s activities are documented through congressional testimonies (he testified to the House Intelligence Committee in Nov 2017, releasing a 200-page transcript) and the Mueller Report’s summary ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=%28Politico%29%20www.politico.eu%20%20,Just%20Security)). His Moscow trip was reported in press (**Washington Post**, July 2016) and later confirmed by Page himself in testimony. The Steele Dossier’s claims about him (dossier dated 2016) influenced the FBI’s FISA warrant applications (partially released and declassified in 2018) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=%28Politico%29%20www.politico.eu%20%20,Russian%20intelligence%20to%20recruit%20him)). The FISA court documents show the FBI’s rationale, citing Page’s past Russian ties and the 2016 trip. The Senate Intelligence Committee’s report and DOJ Inspector General’s report (Dec 2019) provide further detail on Page’s case, noting errors in the FBI’s FISA process but also Page’s misleading statements about his contacts. Page’s own letter to the Senate in 2016 and media interviews (where he praised Putin) round out the picture of his alignments. In sum, multiple independent sources concur that Page met Russian officials in 2016 and was viewed as sufficiently suspicious to investigate, reinforcing his role in the Trump-Russia narrative ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=%28Politico%29%20www.politico.eu%20%20,Just%20Security)).

## Sergey Kislyak  
 ([File:Sergey Ivanovich Kislyak 2016.jpg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sergey_Ivanovich_Kislyak_2016.jpg)) *Sergey Kislyak, Russian Ambassador to the U.S. (2008–2017), photographed in late 2016 at a NASA event ([File:Sergey Ivanovich Kislyak 2016.jpg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sergey_Ivanovich_Kislyak_2016.jpg#:~:text=Description%20Sergey%20Ivanovich%20Kislyak%202016)).*  

**Background:** Sergey Kislyak (born 1950) is a seasoned Russian diplomat who served as Russia’s Ambassador to the United States from 2008 to 2017 ([Sergey Kislyak - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Kislyak#:~:text=Sergey%20Kislyak%20,4%5D%20Previously%20he)). He is a prominent figure in Washington’s diplomatic circuit and was known for aggressively networking with U.S. political figures. Kislyak became somewhat infamous in 2016–2017 as the key Russian point-of-contact for several Trump associates. His long career in the Soviet and Russian Foreign Service (including a stint as Deputy Foreign Minister) made him a central player in implementing the Kremlin’s foreign policy in the U.S., effectively functioning as an intelligence conduit under diplomatic cover (as is common for ambassadors). 

**Interactions with Trump:** Kislyak interacted with multiple high-level Trump campaign and transition officials. During the campaign, he met Trump advisers at events – for example, he spoke briefly with Jeff Sessions (then a Senator and top Trump surrogate) at least twice in 2016, once in Sessions’ Senate office and once at a sideline of the Republican National Convention ([Russia connections in Trump's inner circle](https://apps.voxmedia.com/graphics/vox-trump-russia-lawyers#:~:text=Jeff%20Sessions)) ([Russia connections in Trump's inner circle](https://apps.voxmedia.com/graphics/vox-trump-russia-lawyers#:~:text=Contacts%20with%20Russians%20,while%20part%20of%20Trump%27s%20campaign)). Sessions would later downplay these encounters but had to revise Senate testimony about them. On April 27, 2016, Kislyak attended Trump’s foreign policy speech at the Mayflower Hotel in D.C., where he was seated in the front row and, according to some accounts, greeted Trump and Jared Kushner in a receiving line (though Trump’s team said any contact was brief). The most significant interactions came after Trump’s victory: During the transition, Kislyak was involved in two controversial secret communications. First, in early December 2016, he met Kushner and Michael Flynn at Trump Tower, where Kushner proposed using **secure Russian diplomatic channels** for backchannel talks ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,The%20Atlantic)). U.S. intelligence intercepted Kislyak’s report to Moscow about this unusual suggestion ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,The%20Atlantic)). Second, on December 29, 2016 – the day the Obama administration announced new sanctions on Russia for election interference – Kislyak had multiple phone calls with Michael Flynn ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=3,Sanctions)). In those calls, Flynn privately urged Kislyak that Russia not retaliate harshly to the sanctions, implying the incoming Trump administration would revisit the issue ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)). Kislyak reported Flynn’s message to Moscow, and notably, Putin decided not to retaliate – a surprise move at the time ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)). These Flynn-Kislyak calls became the subject of FBI inquiry (ultimately leading to Flynn’s resignation and guilty plea for lying). Additionally, Kislyak had contact with other Trump figures: he spoke with Sessions at the RNC about the campaign, and he met briefly with advisor J.D. Gordon at a Global Partners in Diplomacy event during the RNC where Gordon discussed the GOP platform stance on Ukraine (Gordon later said he told Kislyak “Trump wants to improve relations with Russia”). 

**Financial, Criminal, and Political Connections:** As a diplomat, Kislyak wasn’t involved in financial dealings, but politically he was central to Russia’s outreach. The FBI and CIA would have considered Kislyak’s communications of high interest (Kislyak was known to be closely monitored by U.S. counterintelligence). He was not accused of wrongdoing – it’s understood an ambassador will attempt to cultivate incoming officials. But the pattern of Kislyak’s interactions with Trump’s team was highly unusual in scope and secrecy. The Kushner backchannel attempt, for instance, alarmed U.S. intelligence and was **politically explosive** when revealed ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,The%20Atlantic)). Kislyak effectively acted as the point man for Russia’s attempt to reset relations with the Trump camp before inauguration. When his contacts (especially with Flynn) came to light, it led to Flynn’s ouster and fueled public suspicion about Trump’s ties to Russia. In July 2017, Kislyak concluded his ambassadorship and returned to Moscow, taking a seat in Russia’s Federation Council (upper parliament). Politically, his tenure ended under a cloud, as he had become a focal point of the U.S. investigations. Some commentators dubbed him “the most radioactive man in Washington.”  

**Role in the Network:** Kislyak can be seen as a **primary channel** through which the Russian government communicated and coordinated with Trump’s circle. In terms of influence network, Kislyak was the official node connecting Putin’s administration to Trump’s incoming administration. He facilitated Flynn’s secret talks (mitigating U.S. sanctions, a huge win for Moscow if successful) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)). He explored creating covert lines of communication (the Kushner proposal) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,The%20Atlantic)). And he engaged Trump advisers in discussions that aligned on improving U.S.-Russia ties. Kislyak’s role is pivotal because it is one of the few instances where we see direct interaction between senior Russian officials and multiple senior members of Team Trump. Unlike cut-outs or intermediaries, Kislyak had the authority to speak for the Kremlin. Therefore, his success in reaching Trump’s team (and in Flynn’s case, altering official Russian reaction) indicates a tangible influence. Kislyak’s outreach also set the stage for later meetings, such as the high-profile Oval Office meeting in May 2017 between Trump, Kislyak, and Foreign Minister Lavrov (where Trump famously disclosed sensitive intelligence and said firing Comey relieved “pressure” about Russia). In summary, Kislyak was the centerpiece of Russia’s diplomatic offensive toward the Trump camp – the embodiment of the Kremlin’s attempt to cultivate a friendly administration and potentially shape its early actions in Russia’s favor ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,of%20personal%20or%20unexplained%20motives)).  

**Sources & Citations:** Kislyak’s interactions are documented through intercepted communications (reported in media and summarized in Mueller’s filings) and participant accounts. The Kushner-Kislyak December 2016 meeting became public via the **Washington Post** in May 2017, and Kushner confirmed it in congressional testimony ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,The%20Atlantic)). Flynn’s calls with Kislyak were detailed in his Statement of Offense (Dec 1, 2017), which recounts Flynn asking Kislyak on Dec 29, 2016 “not to escalate” in response to sanctions ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=3,Sanctions)). The Mueller Report and FBI filings provide further context – including that Kislyak quickly alerted Moscow, and Putin’s surprising non-response to the sanctions the next day ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)). Sessions’ contacts with Kislyak came up in Sessions’ Senate confirmation and were investigated by the Senate Judiciary Committee (Sessions eventually acknowledged meeting Kislyak on April 2016 and July 2016). These various pieces affirm that Kislyak was in touch with at least four Trump associates (Sessions, Kushner, Flynn, Gordon) at critical moments. The Senate Intelligence Committee’s report also covers Flynn’s and Kushner’s dealings with Kislyak as part of its broader findings ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=3,Sanctions)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)).

## Michael Flynn  
 ([File:Michael T Flynn.jpg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Michael_T_Flynn.jpg)) *Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (Ret.), Trump’s first National Security Advisor, in his official 2012 DIA portrait.*  

**Background:** Michael Flynn (born 1958) is a retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General who served as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (2012–2014) ([File:Michael T Flynn.jpg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Michael_T_Flynn.jpg#:~:text=Description%20Michael%20T%20Flynn)). After retiring, he became a vocal critic of the Obama administration and an early Trump supporter. In 2016, Flynn joined the Trump campaign as a top national-security aide and famously led a “Lock her up” chant at the RNC. President-elect Trump named Flynn as National Security Advisor – a post Flynn held for just 24 days before scandal forced his resignation. Notably, prior to his appointment, Flynn had suspicious contacts with foreign governments: he was paid to attend a 2015 gala in Moscow (seated next to Putin) and had lobbying contracts benefiting Turkish interests in 2016. These ties foreshadowed the issues that led to his downfall.  

**Interactions with Trump:** Flynn was a constant presence at Trump’s side during the campaign’s national security briefings and strategy discussions. Post-election, he played a central role in the transition’s dealings with foreign officials – especially the Russians. Flynn’s most consequential interaction was with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in December 2016, as detailed above ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=3,Sanctions)). On December 29, 2016, Flynn took a series of calls from Mar-a-Lago to Kislyak, urging Russia to *refrain from retaliating* to Obama’s new sanctions ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)). Flynn indicated the incoming administration would review sanctions; Kislyak later told Flynn that Russia “had chosen to moderate its response” to the sanctions ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)). Earlier, on December 22, Flynn had also asked Kislyak to delay or defeat an anti-Israel U.N. resolution (a request made at Trump’s direction, showing Flynn acting as a go-between for Trump with Russia on multiple fronts). Flynn kept Trump’s team informed of these contacts – for instance, KT McFarland (deputy NSA designee) wrote in an email that Flynn would talk to Kislyak about the U.N. vote, and noted Russia’s agreement as a “good outcome” ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=3,Sanctions)). As NSA, Flynn was positioned to influence all Russia-related policy. However, due to the controversy over his calls (which he misled the FBI and Vice President Pence about), he was forced to resign on Feb 13, 2017 ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)). In the campaign period, while Flynn’s direct interactions with Russians are less documented, he did sit in on security briefings where Russia’s election interference was discussed, and reportedly at one point Trump jokingly told Flynn to “get on the phone to the Russians” after an intelligence briefing (though it was said in jest, it shows the campaign’s awareness of and perhaps nonchalance about Russian contacts). Flynn’s predisposition was clear: he advocated improved U.S.-Russia cooperation against Islamist terrorism and was broadly sympathetic to Russia’s strategic aims, as evidenced by his Moscow trip and frequent appearances on Russia’s RT network. 

**Financial, Criminal, and Political Connections:** Flynn’s downfall came through criminal charges – he pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to the FBI about his Kislyak contacts ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)). Politically, this was a huge development, making Flynn the first high-ranking Trump official to admit a crime in connection to the Russia probe. Financially, Flynn had been paid $45,000 by RT for the Moscow event and over $500,000 by a Turkish businessman for lobbying (these were not related to Russia directly, but show Flynn’s entanglements with foreign interests) ([Russia connections in Trump's inner circle](https://apps.voxmedia.com/graphics/vox-trump-russia-lawyers#:~:text=Contacts%20with%20Russians%20,discussed%20US%20sanctions%20on%20Russia)) ([Russia connections in Trump's inner circle](https://apps.voxmedia.com/graphics/vox-trump-russia-lawyers#:~:text=Other%20ties%20,interests%20of%20Turkey%20in%202016)). Within the Russia influence network, Flynn stood out as someone with access and authority who acted on Russia’s behalf (albeit under Trump’s orders) *before* taking office. His intervention against sanctions was effectively undermining sitting U.S. policy for Russia’s benefit ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)). The FBI worried that Flynn’s lies about those calls made him susceptible to Russian blackmail (since Kislyak and the Kremlin knew what was said) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)). Indeed, DOJ officials warned the White House on January 26, 2017, that Flynn had been compromised ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)). That dynamic – a top U.S. security official potentially controlled via deception exposed by a foreign adversary – is the epitome of a counterintelligence nightmare. Flynn’s influence persisted though: even after his ouster, Trump tried to get the FBI to drop the case against Flynn (one facet of Mueller’s obstruction investigation), and ultimately Trump pardoned Flynn in November 2020, nullifying his guilty plea. 

**Role in the Network:** Flynn was the **operational link** during the transition where actual policy bargaining with Russia occurred. If we imagine Russia’s influence operation as an effort to first help elect Trump and then secure favorable policies, Flynn is crucial in the latter phase. He directly discussed sanctions relief – a core Russian desire – signaling to Moscow that the new administration might undo punitive measures ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)). This arguably rewarded Russia’s election interference (they got what they wanted: no retaliation from Putin to Obama’s penalties, expecting Trump would go easy on them). Thus, Flynn’s role strongly supports the hypothesis of a “hidden agenda” or understanding: it’s evidence of the incoming administration coordinating with Russia on policy in advance of taking power ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)). Flynn’s case also illustrates the risks of foreign leverage – his false denials gave Russia potential leverage until the FBI exposed them. In the grand scope, Flynn acted out what the Russians may have hoped all their contacts would achieve: real influence over U.S. actions. His importance in the narrative cannot be overstated; as one congressional report put it, Flynn essentially “neutered” the U.S. response to Russian interference by convincing them not to retaliate, an act outside his authority but made possible by the backchannel he opened ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,of%20personal%20or%20unexplained%20motives)). 

**Sources & Citations:** Flynn’s phone calls with Kislyak are documented in court filings from his case (the Statement of Offense, and the FBI 302 interview summaries) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)). The Mueller Report recaps these events with citations to transcripts of the calls obtained via intelligence intercepts ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=3,Sanctions)). Yates’ warning to the White House about Flynn’s lies is described in her public testimony (Senate Judiciary, May 2017) and in Mueller’s report ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)). Flynn’s RT-paid Moscow trip and seat next to Putin were widely reported (with photos, Dec 2015). The House Intelligence Committee’s report (2018) and Senate Intelligence Volume 5 (2020) both discuss Flynn’s interactions as part of the broader Russia picture. Flynn’s own plea agreement provides the authoritative account of his false statements and acknowledges the substance of his Kislyak communications ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)). Together, these sources cement Flynn’s central part in bridging the Trump team and the Russian government in late 2016.

## Sally Yates  
**Background:** Sally Yates (born 1960) is an American lawyer who served as Deputy Attorney General in the Obama administration and briefly as Acting Attorney General in January 2017 ([File:Sally Q. Yates.jpg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sally_Q._Yates.jpg#:~:text=Description%20Sally%20Q)). A 27-year DOJ veteran, Yates was known for her integrity and nonpartisan approach. On January 26, 2017, as Acting AG, Yates met with White House Counsel Don McGahn to urgently warn about Michael Flynn’s misstatements regarding his Russia contacts ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)). Four days later, Trump fired Yates for unrelated reasons (her refusal to enforce the travel ban). Nonetheless, her role in the Trump-Russia timeline is crucial as the official who sounded the alarm from inside the Justice Department.  

**Interactions with Trump:** Yates’ direct interactions with Trump were minimal (limited to routine meetings), but her actions significantly impacted Trump’s team. Her most notable involvement was informing the Trump White House that Flynn had lied about discussing sanctions with Kislyak and that Flynn was vulnerable to Russian blackmail ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)). This occurred in a meeting at the White House where Yates told McGahn that Flynn’s calls with Kislyak did discuss sanctions, contrary to what Flynn had told Vice President Pence and others ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)). She provided transcripts or summaries showing Flynn’s exact words. Yates emphasized that Russians knew Flynn lied and could use that against him (and implicitly against the administration) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)). Despite her warning, the White House did not immediately remove Flynn – they waited 18 more days until the news broke publicly. Yates was dismissed on January 30, 2017, after she directed DOJ attorneys not to defend Trump’s travel ban executive order, but in the context of the Russia matter, her firing raised eyebrows among Trump critics. Later, in May 2017, Yates testified to a Senate subcommittee detailing her warning and expressing concerns about Flynn’s conduct ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)). Trump reacted by disparaging Yates as an Obama appointee out to get him.  

**Financial, Criminal, and Political Connections:** Yates had no personal stake in Trump-Russia matters beyond executing her duties. Her stance was that of a law enforcement official worried about a compromised National Security Advisor. Politically, her actions placed her at odds with the new administration, which may have contributed to a climate of distrust. After Yates’ firing and testimony, Trump and allies tried to paint her warning as partisan, but both Republican and Democratic lawmakers found her account credible. Yates became a key witness in the Mueller investigation (Mueller’s report cites her testimony) and in understanding the administration’s response to the Russia probe. She herself was not involved in any wrongdoing; rather, she became a symbol of institutional resistance to potential malfeasance.  

**Role in the Network:** While Yates was not part of Trump’s influence network, she acted as a **critical gatekeeper** attempting to protect that network from foreign penetration. In a sense, Yates’ role was adversarial to any hidden pro-Russia agenda: she intervened to remove what she perceived as a compromised link (Flynn). Her efforts show that U.S. institutions identified and tried to counter a possible vector of Russian influence at the highest level of the incoming administration ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)). The fact that Flynn’s ouster only occurred after leaks suggests that internal warnings alone were initially insufficient. Yates’ experience underscores a theme: the machinery of U.S. law enforcement was detecting unusual Russia contacts (Flynn, Papadopoulos, Page) and raising red flags, even as Trump’s camp in some cases tried to ignore or dismiss those flags. In the narrative of foreign influence, Yates represents the internal corrective mechanism that sought to sever the risky tie (Flynn-Kislyak) once discovered. Her firing, unrelated but suspicious in timing, and Trump’s later pressure on Comey to drop the Flynn investigation, both hint at an attempt to stifle that corrective action. Thus, Yates’ stand is a significant moment where the potential “Manchurian” influence (through Flynn) was directly confronted from within the U.S. government. 

**Sources & Citations:** Sally Yates’ account is recorded in her Senate testimony (May 8, 2017) and the Mueller Report ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)). The report describes how Yates and a DOJ national security official informed McGahn that Flynn had been “compromised” by the Russians ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)). Contemporary media (e.g. **Washington Post**, Feb 2017) first revealed Yates’ warning and the details of the Flynn/Kislyak call. Yates provided a timeline: she informed the White House on Jan 26, expected action, but saw none until the story went public on Feb 13 ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)). This sequence is also documented in the DOJ Inspector General’s report on Crossfire Hurricane (Dec 2019), which validates DOJ’s concerns about Flynn. Yates’ firing on Jan 30 was officially for insubordination on the travel ban, but as Mueller noted and Yates herself hinted, it removed a key figure involved in raising the alarm on Russia. Her case is well-sourced through official hearing transcripts and the Special Counsel’s investigative records.

## Robert Mueller  
 ([File:Director Robert S. Mueller- III.jpg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Director_Robert_S._Mueller-_III.jpg)) *Robert S. Mueller III, Special Counsel and former FBI Director (2001–2013). Official FBI portrait.*  

**Background:** Robert Mueller (born 1944) is a decorated Marine veteran and career prosecutor who served as the 6th Director of the FBI for 12 years ([File:Director Robert S. Mueller- III.jpg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Director_Robert_S._Mueller-_III.jpg#:~:text=Description%20Director%20Robert%20S.%20Mueller,jpg)). In May 2017, Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller as Special Counsel to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election and any links or coordination with the Trump campaign ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=4)). Mueller brought gravitas and a reputation for integrity to the probe, which came to bear his name. Over 22 months, Mueller led a team of prosecutors and agents who issued over 2,800 subpoenas, interviewed roughly 500 witnesses, and charged 34 individuals (including Russian GRU officers and several Trump associates) ([Mueller Investigation: All of the Guilty Pleas, Indictments | TIME](https://time.com/5556331/mueller-investigation-indictments-guilty-pleas/#:~:text=TIME%20time,Trump%E2%80%99s%20national%20security%20advisor)) ([All the members of Trumpworld who have been charged with criminal acts](https://archive.thinkprogress.org/indictments-investigations-crimes-allegations-trump-associates-ea9aa98e768e/#:~:text=All%20the%20members%20of%20Trumpworld,been%20indicted%20or%20are%20under)).  

**Interactions with Trump:** Mueller’s direct interactions with President Trump were limited (Trump reportedly considered firing Mueller multiple times, and in June 2017 even ordered McGahn to have Mueller removed, but McGahn refused). Trump never sat for an in-person interview with Mueller, only providing written answers to a set of questions (which Mueller found inadequate) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,3)). Throughout the investigation, Trump publicly attacked Mueller, calling it a “witch hunt,” yet behind the scenes he cooperated to a point – allowing staff to be interviewed and documents to be shared – while also entertaining actions to curtail Mueller’s reach (like exploring pardons to keep witnesses on his side). Mueller’s team sought an interview with Trump for over a year, but Trump’s legal team stymied it, and Mueller, not wanting a protracted subpoena fight, did not compel the testimony. Mueller did, however, interview many in Trump’s orbit (including White House Counsel McGahn, Steve Bannon, Hope Hicks, Reince Priebus, etc.) and he scrutinized Trump’s own actions for possible obstruction of justice. In his final report, Mueller pointedly did not exonerate Trump on obstruction, instead documenting 10 episodes where Trump might have obstructed and stating that Department of Justice policy prevented indictment of a sitting president ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,3)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,refuting%20claims%20of%20a%20hoax)). Mueller’s relationship to Trump was thus that of an external investigator whose findings could imperil Trump’s presidency, leading to a tense adversarial dynamic by late 2017. 

**Financial, Criminal, and Political Connections:** Mueller’s probe resulted in criminal charges against multiple Trump associates – Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, George Papadopoulos, Michael Cohen, Roger Stone – though the charges ranged from false statements and lobbying violations to financial crimes, rather than an overarching conspiracy. Politically, Mueller’s work confirmed the U.S. Intelligence Community’s conclusion that Russia interfered in 2016 in “sweeping and systematic fashion” to help Trump ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=4)), and it established over 100 contacts between Trump’s team and Russian-linked individuals ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,3)). While Mueller did not allege a criminal conspiracy (finding insufficient evidence of an agreement between the campaign and Russia), he did underscore the campaign’s receptivity to Russian offers (the Trump Tower meeting, for example) and the campaign’s expectation that it would benefit from stolen emails released by Russia ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=2,Leaks%2C%20Propaganda)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,3)). Financially, Mueller dug into Trump Organization business leads (like the Moscow Project) and suspect flows of money (e.g., to Manafort or the social media influence operations funded by Yevgeny Prigozhin). Some leads (like whether Trump was financially leveraged by Russian interests) fell outside his narrow scope or lacked evidence, so Mueller referred several matters to other DOJ offices. Politically, Mueller’s investigation itself became a flashpoint – prompting Trump to lambaste “13 Angry Democrats” on Mueller’s staff and to rally his base with the narrative that the probe was a partisan coup attempt. Despite intense political pressure, Mueller proceeded methodically and maintained silence publicly until his brief May 2019 statement and July 2019 congressional testimony, where he defended the findings but offered little beyond the report. 

**Role in the Network:** Mueller can be viewed as an **external auditor** of the Trump-Russia network. His role was to map out the interactions (nodes and links) between Trump’s world and Russia’s, and to determine if any crossed legal lines. In doing so, Mueller’s investigation itself influenced the network: it disrupted some relationships (Manafort ceased communicating with Kilimnik and ultimately flipped, albeit unproductively), it deterred further overt contacts (after FBI opened its case in July 2016, certain backchannels may have gone quiet), and it resulted in lies by Trump associates (Papadopoulos, Flynn, Cohen, etc.) which ironically became crimes themselves ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Russian%20intelligence%20to%20recruit%20him)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Flynn%20was%20compromised%E2%80%99%20%28Politico)). Mueller’s final report, submitted March 2019, serves as a definitive historic record of the extent of foreign influence. Within that report, the narrative emerges of a campaign that was *open to* Russian help, even if direct coordination wasn’t proven ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,3)). Mueller effectively shone a light on the network’s operations, enumerating each contact and assessing them. This transparency and the subsequent prosecutions (and convictions) of key players like Manafort and Cohen greatly mitigated the ongoing counterintelligence threat. Arguably, Mueller “neutralized” parts of the network: post-investigation, the Trump team could no longer credibly deny the Russian interference or their numerous contacts, and individuals who facilitated those contacts were either penalized or exposed. In a case-study sense, Mueller’s role is that of the detective who unravels a suspected clandestine web. Politically, his work deeply shook the presidency but ultimately did not remove Trump from power; however, Mueller’s findings laid the groundwork for legislative and public scrutiny that persisted. 

**Sources & Citations:** The Mueller Report (officially “Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election,” Volumes I & II, March 2019) is the primary source for Mueller’s findings ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=4)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,2019)). Its detailed chronology and footnotes cite FBI interviews, communications intercepts, and documents. Mueller’s court filings (indictments of Russian GRU officers ([Mueller Investigation: All of the Guilty Pleas, Indictments | TIME](https://time.com/5556331/mueller-investigation-indictments-guilty-pleas/#:~:text=TIME%20time,Trump%E2%80%99s%20national%20security%20advisor)), IRA trolls, and Trump associates) provide evidence for specific network nodes (for example, the GRU indictment (July 2018) outlines how Russian officers hacked Democrats and coordinated the release of emails, implicitly responding to Trump’s public “Russia, if you’re listening…” request ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=2,Leaks%2C%20Propaganda))). Congressional reports like the Senate Intelligence Committee’s Volume 5 (Aug 2020) generally align with and build on Mueller’s findings, often explicitly citing them. Additionally, Mueller’s team generated evidence in trials (e.g., exhibits in the Manafort and Stone trials that revealed communications). All these show Mueller’s effect: uncovering the truth behind the interactions that prior chapters of this case study examine, and thereby validating many initial concerns about foreign influence on the Trump campaign.

## Vladimir Putin  
 ([File:Vladimir Putin official photo 08.jpg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vladimir_Putin_official_photo_08.jpg)) *Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, in an official portrait (circa 2008).*  

**Background:** Vladimir Putin (born 1952) is a former KGB officer who has been the paramount leader of Russia since 2000 (serving as President for most of that time, with a stint as Prime Minister). Putin’s government is authoritarian and centrally controls Russia’s oligarchs, security services, and foreign policy. Under Putin, Russia has become increasingly adversarial to the West, and Putin has a known preference for leaders who might destabilize Western unity (such as NATO and the EU). By 2016, Putin had been in power 16 years and had overseen aggressive moves like the annexation of Crimea (2014) and interference in foreign elections in Europe. U.S. intelligence assessed that Putin personally ordered the influence campaign to help elect Donald Trump in 2016 ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,refuting%20claims%20of%20a%20hoax)). Putin likely saw Trump as someone who might improve relations or at least take a softer line on Russia’s actions in Ukraine and Syria, and someone who had spoken admiringly of him. Indeed, Putin repeatedly praised Trump during 2016, while disparaging Hillary Clinton (whom Putin blamed for fomenting protests against his regime in 2011). Putin’s central role means any significant Russian intelligence operation or diplomatic outreach would require his approval or knowledge. 

**Interactions with Trump:** Direct interactions between Putin and Trump occurred after the election (they had a brief phone call in November 2016 after Trump won, and officially met in person for the first time in July 2017 at the G20 summit in Hamburg). During the campaign, communication was indirect yet impactful. For instance, Russian Ambassador Kislyak’s reported feedback to the Kremlin (to Putin’s aides) from meetings with Trump representatives would inform Putin of the campaign’s receptivity ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=3,Sanctions)). Also, when Trump publicly invited Russia to hack Clinton’s emails (“Russia, if you’re listening…” on July 27, 2016), within hours Russian military hackers attempted for the first time to break into Clinton’s personal server ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,voters%20and%20assist%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20candidacy)). While not a personal interaction, it demonstrates how Putin’s apparatus was actively responding to Trump’s words – effectively an interaction via intermediaries (the hackers acting on Putin’s likely authorization). Moreover, Putin interacted with Trump indirectly through oligarchs and emissaries: e.g., the Agalarovs (Aras and Emin) who hosted Trump in Moscow in 2013, maintained communication into 2016 about potential Trump Tower Moscow and facilitated the Trump Tower meeting via Goldstone ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,project%20remained%20active%20into%20June)). Putin would certainly have been aware of the Trump Tower Moscow project – his own press secretary Peskov received Cohen’s outreach about it ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=business%20in%20Russia%2C%E2%80%9D%20Cohen%20later,Channel%20Ukraine%20Dossier%E2%80%9D%20%28Just%20Security)) – and while Putin never commented on it during the campaign, Cohen was told the project needed Kremlin approval. It’s reported that Putin was kept informed of the project’s status by his subordinates ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=business%20in%20Russia%2C%E2%80%9D%20Cohen%20later,Channel%20Ukraine%20Dossier%E2%80%9D%20%28Just%20Security)). After Trump took office, Putin had more direct interactions: notably, the two had a controversial private meeting in Helsinki in July 2018 with no Americans present except interpreters (what was discussed remains partly mysterious). But during the 2015–2016 period of this case study, Putin’s role was to oversee and green-light Russia’s multi-faceted approach to the election rather than personally meet Trump. 

**Financial, Criminal, and Political Connections:** Putin sits atop Russia’s power structure that interfaced with Trump’s network. Financially, Putin’s regime offered Trump’s business an extremely lucrative deal (the Moscow tower) which could be seen as an incentive dangled during the campaign ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=Trump%20consistently%20told%20the%20public,question%20stands%20to%20gain%20financially)). Politically, Putin used state resources – hackers, propagandists, diplomats – to influence the U.S. electorate in Trump’s favor ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,refuting%20claims%20of%20a%20hoax)). The U.S. intelligence community’s January 2017 assessment concluded Putin sought to undermine faith in U.S. democracy and harm Hillary Clinton’s candidacy, and had developed a clear preference for Trump ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,refuting%20claims%20of%20a%20hoax)). Criminally, Putin’s government’s actions (hacking Democratic servers, for instance) were crimes under U.S. law, leading to Mueller’s indictment of 12 GRU officers ([Mueller Investigation: All of the Guilty Pleas, Indictments | TIME](https://time.com/5556331/mueller-investigation-indictments-guilty-pleas/#:~:text=TIME%20time,Trump%E2%80%99s%20national%20security%20advisor)). While Putin himself is beyond the reach of U.S. law, those operations occurred under his command. Politically, Putin achieved significant short-term successes: Trump echoed pro-Russian talking points (questioning NATO’s value, considering recognizing Crimea, etc.), and once elected, Trump was reluctant to criticize Putin and took steps in line with Russia’s interests (attempting to ease sanctions, delaying lethal aid to Ukraine – until Congress or advisers pushed back) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=4,Objectives)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,of%20personal%20or%20unexplained%20motives)). Putin’s leverage over Trump has been debated – some pointed to possible kompromat (like rumored sordid footage per the Steele Dossier, or knowledge of illicit finances). No hard evidence of such kompromat has emerged publicly, but Trump’s unusually deferential posture toward Putin (exemplified in Helsinki 2018 when Trump sided with Putin’s denial over U.S. intelligence) fueled speculation. In any case, politically Putin benefited from chaos in America and a presidency more sympathetic to Moscow’s view. 

**Role in the Network:** Vladimir Putin is the **ultimate architect** of the Russian side of the network. All roads lead to Putin – whether it’s the oligarchs (who operate at his pleasure), the diplomats (who follow his foreign policy), or the intelligence agents (who answer to him). If Trump or his associates were influenced by Russian efforts, Putin was the one orchestrating those efforts ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,refuting%20claims%20of%20a%20hoax)). In a Manchurian Candidate framework, Putin is the potential handler or sponsor of the candidate. The question Mueller examined was: did Trump knowingly or unknowingly act in ways that served Putin’s agenda, and was there any coordination? Mueller did not establish a criminal conspiracy with Putin’s government, but he documented numerous parallel interests and contacts. Putin’s direct influence manifested in Russia’s hacking and disinformation campaign that boosted Trump ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,3)). It also manifested in the carrot offered (business deal, improved relations) and stick implied (Russia could release damaging info if it chose). Even without a formal agreement, Trump’s statements and actions often aligned with Putin’s goals (e.g., advocating better relations, downplaying Russian interference). Within the narrative of foreign influence, Putin stands as the central adversary figure – cunning, strategically patient, and skilled at exploiting opportunities. By deploying a combination of cyber warfare, propaganda, and old-fashioned diplomacy (through people like Kislyak), Putin inserted Russia into the 2016 election in unprecedented ways ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,refuting%20claims%20of%20a%20hoax)). He tested and possibly weakened America’s political resiliency. In summary, Putin’s role was that of the prime mover who set the network in motion to advance Russia’s interests by tipping the scales for Trump, and then to capitalize on that favorable outcome by engaging the Trump team through official and back channels ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,refuting%20claims%20of%20a%20hoax)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,of%20personal%20or%20unexplained%20motives)). 

**Sources & Citations:** The U.S. Intelligence Community Assessment (Jan 6, 2017) explicitly states “Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election” ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,refuting%20claims%20of%20a%20hoax)). Mueller’s indictment of GRU officers (July 13, 2018) provides granular detail on how Russian military intelligence, assuredly with Putin’s blessing, hacked Democrats and timed releases to damage Clinton ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,Propaganda%3A%20Russian%20troll%20farm%20orchestrated)). Mueller’s report devotes an entire section to Russia’s “governmental” actions, consistently attributing ultimate authority to Putin ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,refuting%20claims%20of%20a%20hoax)). Testimony by FBI Director James Comey (March 20, 2017 House hearing) and others reinforces that nothing in Russia happens without Putin – he is the decision-maker for the DNC hack operation and other measures. Additionally, Putin’s own public comments can be telling: in late 2016 he spoke favorably of Trump’s qualities, and in October 2016, Putin (implausibly) claimed Russia wasn’t involved in any hacks but said the leaks were a public service. His interactions with Trump post-2016 (Hamburg 2017, Helsinki 2018 summits) are documented in press and congressional inquiries (especially Helsinki, where no U.S. notes exist – illustrating Putin’s insistence on secrecy in direct talks). These sources underscore Putin’s dominance and direct involvement as the linchpin of Russia’s side of the influence network ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,refuting%20claims%20of%20a%20hoax)).

A visual graph would show multiple linkages converging on the campaign: e.g., **Goldstone** → Trump Jr. (meeting) → **Veselnitskaya** → Chaika/Putin; **Sater** → Cohen (deal) → Peskov/Putin; **Kilimnik** ↔ Manafort (data) ↔ Deripaska/Putin; **Kislyak** ↔ Flynn/Kushner (policy) ↔ Putin. Trump himself publicly encouraged Russia (“Russia, if you’re listening...”) and benefited from Russia’s cyber actions ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,voters%20and%20assist%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20candidacy)). The network map underscores that, while not a formal conspiracy, there was an unusual frequency of interactions and parallel interests aligning Trump’s operation with Putin’s efforts. Each connection provided a pathway for influence or information flow, raising the overall risk profile for foreign leverage on an American presidential candidate ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,3)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,refuting%20claims%20of%20a%20hoax)).

This timeline and analysis illustrate a pattern: **from 2015 onward, Trump’s world and Putin’s world moved into increasing synergy**, via secret deals, mutual strategic benefit, and communication through intermediaries. Each chapter of this case study – financial entanglements, covert meetings, backchannels, interference operations, and obstructive behavior – reinforces the possibility that Donald Trump’s actions were influenced by a constellation of foreign connections. While definitive proof of a quid-pro-quo “Manchurian” arrangement remains elusive, the cumulative evidence of alignment and opportunism is “hyper-accurate” as documented above, drawn from verified sources and official records ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,2019)) ([DJT/Tmanch_CH5.md at main · mfreeze77/DJT · GitHub](https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/blob/main/Tmanch_CH5.md#:~:text=,refuting%20claims%20of%20a%20hoax)). The structured profiles of the individuals involved underscore their functions and interconnections within this far-reaching network of influence.
