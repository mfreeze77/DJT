# Donald Trump’s Financial Dealings (2022–2025)

## Real Estate & Business Transactions (2022–2025)
Trump’s post-presidency period saw significant reshuffling of his real estate portfolio and business partnerships. **Major property sales** included the lucrative divestment of his Washington, D.C. hotel. In May 2022, the Trump Organization sold its lease of the Old Post Office (formerly the Trump International Hotel) for a reported $375 million, yielding an estimated profit of about $100 million ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=On%20May%2011%2C%202022%2C%20the,a%20loan%20he%20needed%20to)) ([Trump Signs Removed After Family's D.C. Hotel Sells for $375 Million](https://people.com/politics/trump-washington-hotel-sold-375-million-signs-removed/#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20the%20average%20price,over%20%241%20million%20per%20room)). This sale allowed Trump to pay off the hotel’s $170 million Deutsche Bank loan in full ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=On%20May%2011%2C%202022%2C%20the,a%20loan%20he%20needed%20to)). Notably, while the hotel had lost over $70 million during Trump’s presidency ([Trump Signs Removed After Family's D.C. Hotel Sells for $375 Million](https://people.com/politics/trump-washington-hotel-sold-375-million-signs-removed/#:~:text=Congressional%20Investigators%20Say)), the sale price – over $1 million per room – surprised industry observers and erased those losses. Another disposition came in 2023 when the Trump Organization agreed to **sell its rights to the Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point (Bronx, NY)**. Gaming company Bally’s paid on the order of tens of millions (reportedly about $60 million) to take over the remaining city lease of the golf course, marking Trump’s exit from that venture amid prior efforts by New York City to cancel his contract ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=Organization%20sold%20the%20rights%20to,60)).

**New business deals and partnerships** have centered on overseas projects and branding ventures. In November 2022, the Trump Organization signed a licensing agreement with Saudi developer Dar Al Arkan for a $4 billion project in Oman, which will feature a Trump-branded golf course, hotel, and villas ([Saudi Arabia's Dar Al Arkan signs deal with Trump family for Oman project | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/saudi-arabias-dar-al-arkan-signs-deal-with-trump-family-oman-project-2022-11-20/#:~:text=DUBAI%2C%20Nov%2020%20%28Reuters%29%20,golf%20course%2C%20hotel%20and%20villas)). The financial terms of this deal were not disclosed ([Saudi Arabia's Dar Al Arkan signs deal with Trump family for Oman project | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/saudi-arabias-dar-al-arkan-signs-deal-with-trump-family-oman-project-2022-11-20/#:~:text=The%20regulatory%20statement%20issued%20on,real%20estate%20around%20the%20world)), but Trump’s 2024 disclosure shows an initial $2.5 million earned from the Oman project ([Trump reported $700 million of business income, hundreds of millions in debt, on latest financial disclosure - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/trump-reported-700-million-of-business-income-hundreds-of-millions-in-debt-on-latest-financial-disclosure/#:~:text=Trump%20took%20in%20over%20%2415,the%20UAE%20announced%20last%20month)). This Oman resort, slated to open by 2028, expands Trump’s Middle East portfolio beyond his two Dubai golf courses operated with Damac Properties ([Saudi Arabia's Dar Al Arkan signs deal with Trump family for Oman project | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/saudi-arabias-dar-al-arkan-signs-deal-with-trump-family-oman-project-2022-11-20/#:~:text=The%20Trump%20Organization%20has%20two,partnership%20with%20property%20developer%20Damac)). Additionally, in mid-2024 Trump Org announced plans (with Dar Al Arkan’s international arm) for new luxury towers in the Saudi/UAE region ([Trump reported $700 million of business income, hundreds of millions in debt, on latest financial disclosure - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/trump-reported-700-million-of-business-income-hundreds-of-millions-in-debt-on-latest-financial-disclosure/#:~:text=Trump%20took%20in%20over%20%2415,the%20UAE%20announced%20last%20month)), signaling continued pursuit of international licensing opportunities. These ventures suggest a strategic shift: after facing reputational and political hurdles in U.S. markets, the Trump business is leveraging its brand in foreign projects for fee-based revenue rather than risky domestic acquisitions.

**The financial health of Trump Organization assets** post-2021 has been mixed. Hospitality and resort properties rebounded strongly as pandemic pressures eased – for example, Trump’s Doral golf resort near Miami generated about $160 million in revenue in the recent reporting period ([Trump reported $700 million of business income, hundreds of millions in debt, on latest financial disclosure - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/trump-reported-700-million-of-business-income-hundreds-of-millions-in-debt-on-latest-financial-disclosure/#:~:text=year%20and%20this%20month%2C%20according,from%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20Truth%20Social%20holdings)) and is estimated to net roughly $20 million in annual profit ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=estimated%20%24100%20million%20or%20so,million%20shy%20of%20the%20cutoff)), buoyed in part by hosting Saudi-backed LIV Golf tournaments. Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s private club in Florida, pulled in roughly $56 million over a similar period ([Trump reported $700 million of business income, hundreds of millions in debt, on latest financial disclosure - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/trump-reported-700-million-of-business-income-hundreds-of-millions-in-debt-on-latest-financial-disclosure/#:~:text=year%20and%20this%20month%2C%20according,from%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20Truth%20Social%20holdings)), as it became a hub for GOP events once Trump left office. In Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump’s golf club earned about $37 million ([Trump reported $700 million of business income, hundreds of millions in debt, on latest financial disclosure - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/trump-reported-700-million-of-business-income-hundreds-of-millions-in-debt-on-latest-financial-disclosure/#:~:text=year%20and%20this%20month%2C%20according,from%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20Truth%20Social%20holdings)), also boosted by LIV golf events and post-presidency patronage. These figures indicate healthier income streams at Trump’s resorts and clubs, often supplemented by high-profile tournaments and political functions. In contrast, some of Trump’s commercial real estate holdings in urban centers have struggled with vacancies and lower valuations. Trump Tower in Manhattan has long battled to fill space – occupancy dipped below 79% in 2020 ([Trump Tower Mortgage Refinanced for $100M](https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2022/03/09/trump-tower-scores-mortgage-100m-refi/#:~:text=At%20the%20time%2C%20the%20loan%E2%80%99s,7%20million%20for%20that%20year)) and remained around 75% in early 2021 ([Trump PAC Pays $37K Rent at Trump Tower](https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2021/09/03/trump-pac-a-key-tenant-at-strained-trump-tower/#:~:text=The%20Trump%20Organization%20occupies%20two,occupancy%20rate%20in%20eight%20years)), with some tenants in arrears on rent. Likewise, 40 Wall Street (the Trump Building in New York’s Financial District) is only about 77% leased as of mid-2023 ([40 Wall Street Transfers to Special Servicing Amid Trump Fraud Trial – Commercial Observer](https://commercialobserver.com/2023/11/40-wall-street-transfers-to-special-servicing-amid-trump-fraud-trial/#:~:text=Rialto%20did%20not%20immediately%20respond,to%20a%20request%20for%20comment)) amid a weak office market. Trump’s minority stakes in two major office towers operated by Vornado Realty Trust have also lost value: the 555 California Street skyscraper in San Francisco saw its appraised value drop by an estimated $100 million, and 1290 Avenue of the Americas in NYC fell roughly $60 million in value, according to Forbes ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=On%20October%203%2C%202023%2C%20Forbes,361%2C%20has%20about%20%2420)). These declines reflect high vacancy rates (San Francisco’s office vacancy ~28% ([Vornado and Trump Seek Extension on SF Tower Loan](https://therealdeal.com/san-francisco/2023/03/28/vornado-and-trump-seek-loan-extension-at-555-california-street-in-sf/#:~:text=The%20office%20vacancy%20in%20San,%E2%80%9D))) and rising interest rates that have hurt office real estate. Overall, Trump’s businesses have pivoted toward hospitality and international brand licensing – sectors where his post-presidential profile attracts clientele – while his U.S. commercial properties face headwinds.

## Debt & Liquidity
Trump **restructured significant debt** coming due in the mid-2020s, though substantial loan obligations remain. In early 2022, as questions arose about his company’s finances, Trump secured new financing from Axos Bank to refinance two of his largest mortgages. In February 2022 – the same month his longtime accounting firm Mazars disavowed a decade’s worth of his financial statements – Axos provided a $100 million, 10-year loan on Trump Tower in Manhattan ([Trump Tower Mortgage Refinanced for $100M](https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2022/03/09/trump-tower-scores-mortgage-100m-refi/#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%20secured%20a%20%24100,Fifth%20Avenue%20building%20on%20notice)) ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=In%20February%202022%2C%20Trump%27s%20longtime,55)). This replaced a similar loan from Ladder Capital that was due in September 2022 and had been placed on a watchlist due to low occupancy and revenue at Trump Tower ([Trump Tower Mortgage Refinanced for $100M](https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2022/03/09/trump-tower-scores-mortgage-100m-refi/#:~:text=The%20refinancing%20of%20the%20commercial,president%20himself)) ([Trump Tower Mortgage Refinanced for $100M](https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2022/03/09/trump-tower-scores-mortgage-100m-refi/#:~:text=The%20previous%20%24100%20million%20mortgage%2C,2%20million%2C%20according%20to%20PincusCo)). A few months later in May 2022, Axos Bank also lent Trump $125 million (10-year term at ~4.9% interest) against his Trump National Doral resort in Florida ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=In%20February%202022%2C%20Trump%27s%20longtime,55)). These refinancing deals – personally authorized by Axos’s CEO – were notable because many mainstream lenders had distanced themselves from Trump after January 6, 2021 ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=Following%20the%20storming%20of%20the,Trump%20Organization%2C%20which%20include%20ice)). The infusions from Axos relieved near-term pressure by extending maturities into the 2030s, albeit at moderate interest rates.

Despite those refinancings, Trump’s **debt load in 2023–2024 remained sizable**, and rising rates have increased carrying costs. According to Trump’s August 2024 federal disclosure, he reported at least **$346 million (and up to $455 million) in liabilities** ([Trump reported $700 million of business income, hundreds of millions in debt, on latest financial disclosure - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/trump-reported-700-million-of-business-income-hundreds-of-millions-in-debt-on-latest-financial-disclosure/#:~:text=Trump%20reported%20at%20least%20%24346,legitimacy%2C%20as%20of%20December%202023)). This figure includes about $101 million in new judgment debts – notably the $5 million verdict owed to E. Jean Carroll and a reserve for potential penalties from the New York Attorney General’s civil fraud case ([Trump reported $700 million of business income, hundreds of millions in debt, on latest financial disclosure - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/trump-reported-700-million-of-business-income-hundreds-of-millions-in-debt-on-latest-financial-disclosure/#:~:text=Trump%20reported%20at%20least%20%24346,legitimacy%2C%20as%20of%20December%202023)). Excluding legal liabilities, the bulk of Trump’s debt is tied to his real estate holdings. Major mortgages include roughly **$122 million remaining on a $160 million loan** against 40 Wall Street in NYC (3.67% interest) which **matures in July 2025** ([40 Wall Street Transfers to Special Servicing Amid Trump Fraud Trial – Commercial Observer](https://commercialobserver.com/2023/11/40-wall-street-transfers-to-special-servicing-amid-trump-fraud-trial/#:~:text=Current%20occupancy%20at%2040%20Wall,67%20percent)). In late 2023, that loan was **transferred to “special servicing”** amid uncertainties caused by the NY civil fraud trial’s initial ruling to dissolve some of Trump’s business certificates ([40 Wall Street Transfers to Special Servicing Amid Trump Fraud Trial – Commercial Observer](https://commercialobserver.com/2023/11/40-wall-street-transfers-to-special-servicing-amid-trump-fraud-trial/#:~:text=The%20Trump%20Organization%20has%20yet,special%20servicing%2C%20according%20to%20reports)) ([40 Wall Street Transfers to Special Servicing Amid Trump Fraud Trial – Commercial Observer](https://commercialobserver.com/2023/11/40-wall-street-transfers-to-special-servicing-amid-trump-fraud-trial/#:~:text=New%20York%20State%20Supreme%20Court,servicing%2C%20according%20to%20the%20source)). (An appellate stay halted the immediate threat, and Trump Org insists it never missed a payment ([40 Wall Street Transfers to Special Servicing Amid Trump Fraud Trial – Commercial Observer](https://commercialobserver.com/2023/11/40-wall-street-transfers-to-special-servicing-amid-trump-fraud-trial/#:~:text=The%20Appellate%20Division%2C%20however%2C%20issued,into%20receivership%2C%20the%20source%20clarified)).) Likewise, Trump’s 30% stake in San Francisco’s 555 California St. tower carries a share of a **$1.2 billion mortgage**. With that floating-rate loan’s monthly payments up nearly 40% due to interest rate hikes, Trump and partner Vornado Realty **exercised extension options in 2023** to push out the loan term ([Vornado and Trump Seek Extension on SF Tower Loan](https://therealdeal.com/san-francisco/2023/03/28/vornado-and-trump-seek-loan-extension-at-555-california-street-in-sf/#:~:text=Vornado%20Realty%20Trust%20and%20The,San%20Francisco%2C%20according%20to%20Trepp)) ([Vornado and Trump Seek Extension on SF Tower Loan](https://therealdeal.com/san-francisco/2023/03/28/vornado-and-trump-seek-loan-extension-at-555-california-street-in-sf/#:~:text=The%20owners%20are%20on%20time,loan%20was%20made%20and%20totaled)).  

Trump’s overall liquidity situation appears mixed. The **sale of the D.C. hotel** in 2022 likely bolstered his cash reserves (netting $ hundred-million range) ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=On%20May%2011%2C%202022%2C%20the,a%20loan%20he%20needed%20to)), and his businesses’ revenues have been on the upswing (over $700 million since January 2023) ([Trump reported $700 million of business income, hundreds of millions in debt, on latest financial disclosure - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/trump-reported-700-million-of-business-income-hundreds-of-millions-in-debt-on-latest-financial-disclosure/#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20businesses%20took%20in,from%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20Truth%20Social%20holdings)), which can support debt service. However, the combination of high leverage and restricted access to traditional lenders could pose challenges. New York’s judge in the civil fraud case ordered that Trump-owned companies be barred from **borrowing from banks chartered in New York until 2027** ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=Because%20the%20ruling%20in%20the,52)). If that holds, Trump would be increasingly reliant on non-traditional financiers – such as niche banks or foreign capital – for any refinancing needs. Indeed, his reliance on Axos (a California-based bank) and overtures to Middle East partners underscore this shift. Moreover, Trump **quietly “terminated” a mysterious $50 million internal loan** tied to his Chicago tower at the end of 2023 ([Trump reported $700 million of business income, hundreds of millions in debt, on latest financial disclosure - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/trump-reported-700-million-of-business-income-hundreds-of-millions-in-debt-on-latest-financial-disclosure/#:~:text=Trump%20reported%20at%20least%20%24346,legitimacy%2C%20as%20of%20December%202023)). That loan’s legitimacy had been questioned (New York investigators suggested it was a tax avoidance scheme), and its cancellation may indicate an effort to clean up his balance sheet ahead of further scrutiny. While Trump remains a billionaire on paper, the convergence of large debt maturities, higher interest costs, and legal constraints on his businesses has led analysts to watch for signs of **financial strain**. Thus far, Trump has averted any acute liquidity crisis by refinancing and asset sales, but significant liabilities loom on the horizon. 

## Revenue Streams & Income
Trump’s income streams since 2022 have been diverse, spanning real estate earnings, business sales, branding deals, media ventures, and even memorabilia. According to his 2023–2024 disclosures, **Trump’s businesses grossed roughly $732 million (at minimum) from January 2023 to mid-2024** ([Trump reported $700 million of business income, hundreds of millions in debt, on latest financial disclosure - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/trump-reported-700-million-of-business-income-hundreds-of-millions-in-debt-on-latest-financial-disclosure/#:~:text=The%20disclosure%20shows%20that%20Trump%E2%80%99s,assets%20when%20they%20exceed%20%245)), reflecting a post-pandemic rebound. Major **real estate revenues** come from his resorts, golf clubs, commercial properties, and residential projects. For example, Trump’s **Doral golf resort** in Florida and **Mar-a-Lago club** in Palm Beach are top earners (with ~$160 million and $56 million in revenue, respectively, over the recent reporting period) ([Trump reported $700 million of business income, hundreds of millions in debt, on latest financial disclosure - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/trump-reported-700-million-of-business-income-hundreds-of-millions-in-debt-on-latest-financial-disclosure/#:~:text=year%20and%20this%20month%2C%20according,from%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20Truth%20Social%20holdings)). His golf clubs in Bedminster (NJ) and Loudoun County (VA) also saw tens of millions in revenue, boosted by hosting high-profile LIV Golf tournaments ([Trump reported $700 million of business income, hundreds of millions in debt, on latest financial disclosure - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/trump-reported-700-million-of-business-income-hundreds-of-millions-in-debt-on-latest-financial-disclosure/#:~:text=Trump%E2%80%99s%20DC%2C%20Miami%20and%20Bedminster%2C,million%20and%20%2437%20million%2C%20respectively)). These properties generate income through membership fees, events, hospitality, and in some cases residential real-estate sales. Trump’s commercial office buildings, like Trump Tower and 40 Wall Street, provide rental income (though occupancy challenges have affected their cash flow). For instance, Trump Tower’s **office and retail space yielded about $33.7 million in 2020** ([Trump Tower Mortgage Refinanced for $100M](https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2022/03/09/trump-tower-scores-mortgage-100m-refi/#:~:text=At%20the%20time%2C%20the%20loan%E2%80%99s,7%20million%20for%20that%20year)) and has had a steady tenant in Trump’s own PAC renting space at $37,500/month ([Trump PAC Pays $37K Rent at Trump Tower](https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2021/09/03/trump-pac-a-key-tenant-at-strained-trump-tower/#:~:text=As%20other%20tenants%20have%20racked,according%20to%20the%20Washington%20Post)). Internationally, Trump-branded developments continue to pay him licensing or management fees – such as the Trump Towers in Turkey and the Philippines, and golf resorts in Scotland and Ireland (though the European golf resorts have historically operated at a loss). In total, Trump reported over **$700 million in “business income”** across his entities for 2022-2024, albeit this represents gross revenue, not profit ([Trump reported $700 million of business income, hundreds of millions in debt, on latest financial disclosure - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/trump-reported-700-million-of-business-income-hundreds-of-millions-in-debt-on-latest-financial-disclosure/#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20businesses%20took%20in,from%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20Truth%20Social%20holdings)).

Trump has also capitalized on **new monetization strategies and one-time windfalls**. A notable boost came from the **sale of the D.C. hotel lease**, which not only erased debt but likely put a substantial sum in the Trump Organization’s accounts ([Trump Signs Removed After Family's D.C. Hotel Sells for $375 Million](https://people.com/politics/trump-washington-hotel-sold-375-million-signs-removed/#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20the%20average%20price,over%20%241%20million%20per%20room)). Beyond real estate, Trump ventured into the digital collectibles craze: in late 2022 he launched a series of **NFT “Trump Cards”** featuring cartoonish images of himself as superheroes and astronauts. The NFT collections sold out twice (December 2022 and April 2023), and Trump’s share of the proceeds was significant – about **$7 million in licensing income from the NFTs** was disclosed ([Trump reported $700 million of business income, hundreds of millions in debt, on latest financial disclosure - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/trump-reported-700-million-of-business-income-hundreds-of-millions-in-debt-on-latest-financial-disclosure/#:~:text=Trump%20took%20in%20over%20%2415,the%20UAE%20announced%20last%20month)). He also published a high-priced coffee-table **book, *Our Journey Together*,** in late 2021, which had gross sales around $20 million within months ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=Merchandise)). Royalties from this book and a follow-up volume provided him income in 2022. In an unusual crossover of faith and business, Trump earned an estimated **$300,000 in royalties from a $59.99 “Trump Bible”** – a Bible edition he endorsed and signed for a profit ([Trump owns $1 million in crypto. He's also made ... - CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-income-wealth-financial-disclosure-forms-bible-sales-crypto-nfts/#:~:text=Trump%20owns%20%241%20million%20in,Bible%20he%20endorsed%20in)). Furthermore, Trump has drawn fees from **speaking engagements and media appearances**. In December 2021, he embarked on a paid speaking tour (“History Tour”) with Bill O’Reilly, for which tickets and VIP packages sold for hundreds to thousands of dollars ([Trump starts speaking tour in Florida as shows fail to sell out](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-bill-reilly-tour-b1974040.html#:~:text=independent,available%20for%20several%20thousand%20dollars)). While exact profits are not publicly known, such events suggest another income avenue outside of politics. Similarly, Trump was paid to provide ringside commentary for a 2021 boxing match, signaling his willingness to monetize his celebrity.

Trump’s **investments and financial holdings** also contribute to his income. Filings show he holds various assets ranging from real estate partnership stakes to marketable securities and cash. Notably, Trump reported owning **cryptocurrency investments worth between $500,000 and $1 million** in 2023 – a possible byproduct of accepting crypto payments for the NFTs or other transactions ([Trump owns $1 million in crypto. He's also made ... - CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-income-wealth-financial-disclosure-forms-bible-sales-crypto-nfts/#:~:text=Trump%20owns%20%241%20million%20in,Bible%20he%20endorsed%20in)). He also earned over **$15 million in licensing fees** during the recent disclosure period ([Trump reported $700 million of business income, hundreds of millions in debt, on latest financial disclosure - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/trump-reported-700-million-of-business-income-hundreds-of-millions-in-debt-on-latest-financial-disclosure/#:~:text=Trump%20took%20in%20over%20%2415,the%20UAE%20announced%20last%20month)). This includes traditional real estate branding deals (for instance, **$4.3 million from projects in Dubai** ([Trump reported $700 million of business income, hundreds of millions in debt, on latest financial disclosure - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/trump-reported-700-million-of-business-income-hundreds-of-millions-in-debt-on-latest-financial-disclosure/#:~:text=Trump%20took%20in%20over%20%2415,the%20UAE%20announced%20last%20month))) and the aforementioned digital ventures. Meanwhile, Trump’s **Social Media and tech venture** (Truth Social, discussed below) has not yet been a major cash generator for him – his holding company showed only ~$6 million in revenue attributable to Truth Social in the recent filing ([Trump reported $700 million of business income, hundreds of millions in debt, on latest financial disclosure - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/trump-reported-700-million-of-business-income-hundreds-of-millions-in-debt-on-latest-financial-disclosure/#:~:text=year%20and%20this%20month%2C%20according,from%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20Truth%20Social%20holdings)), and he is currently unable to cash out his large ownership stake. Finally, it’s worth noting that Trump **no longer draws a federal salary** (he donated or declined his presidential salary while in office), but he does receive a pension as a former President (on the order of $220,000 annually). In sum, Trump’s post-2022 income streams have been bolstered by property operations and sales, entrepreneurial ventures (books, NFTs), and ongoing brand licensing, collectively keeping him financially afloat despite the loss of some previous deals and the costs of his legal battles.

## Legal & Tax Matters
Trump’s finances since 2022 have been entangled with numerous **legal challenges, audits, and investigations**, some resulting in fines or looming penalties. A major development was the New York State **civil fraud lawsuit** filed by Attorney General Letitia James in September 2022, alleging that Trump and his company grossly inflated asset valuations to defraud lenders, insurers, and tax authorities. The AG seeks $250 million in penalties and a ban on Trump’s companies operating in New York. In a pre-trial ruling in fall 2023, Judge Arthur Engoron found Trump’s financial statements were fraudulent, and ordered the cancellation of several New York business certificates – a decision that, if upheld, could force Trump to relinquish iconic properties like Trump Tower ([40 Wall Street Transfers to Special Servicing Amid Trump Fraud Trial – Commercial Observer](https://commercialobserver.com/2023/11/40-wall-street-transfers-to-special-servicing-amid-trump-fraud-trial/#:~:text=The%20transfer%20to%20special%20servicer%2C,is%20at%20the%20center%20of)) ([40 Wall Street Transfers to Special Servicing Amid Trump Fraud Trial – Commercial Observer](https://commercialobserver.com/2023/11/40-wall-street-transfers-to-special-servicing-amid-trump-fraud-trial/#:~:text=certificates%20associated%20with%20The%20Trump,servicing%2C%20according%20to%20the%20source)). (An appeals court temporarily stayed that order.) This case goes to the heart of Trump’s asset valuations and could have profound financial consequences: James’s suit aims to claw back what she calls ill-gotten gains and restrict Trump Org’s future operations. As a side effect, news of the potential dissolution of Trump entities even caused a **$160 million loan on 40 Wall Street to be flagged by servicers** out of concern ([40 Wall Street Transfers to Special Servicing Amid Trump Fraud Trial – Commercial Observer](https://commercialobserver.com/2023/11/40-wall-street-transfers-to-special-servicing-amid-trump-fraud-trial/#:~:text=The%20Trump%20Organization%20has%20yet,special%20servicing%2C%20according%20to%20reports)). Trump has vehemently denied wrongdoing, but at trial his longtime accountants testified to errors, and evidence showed practices like claiming tripled square footage for an apartment to justify a higher net worth. The trial (ongoing as of early 2025) will determine the exact financial penalties and injunctive relief.

Separately, Trump’s business was **criminally convicted of tax fraud** in New York in late 2022. Two Trump Organization entities were found guilty on 17 counts related to a scheme that paid certain executives (including CFO Allen Weisselberg) off-the-books perks in lieu of salary. In January 2023, a judge fined the Trump Organization $1.6 million – the maximum under law ([Political spending tops $1.8 million at Trump properties this cycle - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/political-spending-tops-1-8-million-at-trump-properties-this-cycle/#:~:text=As%20Trump%20faced%20financial%20pressures,Trump%20Save%20America%20Joint%20Fundraising)). While the fine was relatively small, the conviction further tarnished the company’s compliance record. Weisselberg himself pleaded guilty and served time in jail for accepting untaxed perks (luxury cars, an apartment, etc.), and testified at trial that the company benefited from these practices. These revelations may have spurred the **Trump Org to implement tighter internal controls** post-conviction, and they provided evidence in the parallel civil case about the company’s willingness to misstate finances.

Trump’s **tax returns and IRS audits** also drew attention. In late 2022, the House Ways and Means Committee successfully obtained and released six years of Trump’s tax returns (2015–2020), which showed he paid $0 in federal income taxes in 2020 and only $750 in 2017, largely due to heavy business losses ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=For%20federal%20income%20taxes%2C%20Trump,49)). The disclosures confirmed that Trump carried forward huge net operating losses and utilized aggressive deductions to minimize tax bills – raising questions about the legitimacy of some claims. The Committee’s report also revealed the IRS had failed to timely audit Trump in the first two years of his presidency despite a mandatory audit policy ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=Hotel%20in%20Washington%2C%20D.C.,)). That revelation spurred the IRS to begin audits belatedly; however, any results of those audits have not been made public. One longstanding audit involves Trump’s claim of a ~$70 million refund related to a 2009 loss – an issue that could, if resolved against him, cost him substantial money. Additionally, in January 2023, House Democrats reported Trump’s businesses received at least **$7.8 million from foreign governments** during his presidency (e.g. hotel stays by officials), which Trump admitted to and defended by saying “I was doing services for that” ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=including%20swords%20and%20daggers,51)). Rep. Jamie Raskin formally urged Trump to return those foreign profits to the U.S. Treasury as required by the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause, though no repayment has occurred ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=including%20swords%20and%20daggers,51)). While this concerns his time in office, it underscores ongoing legal scrutiny of Trump’s mingling of public position and private profit. 

Beyond the business realm, Trump personally has been hit with **civil judgments that carry financial costs**. In May 2023, a federal jury found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation against writer E. Jean Carroll, ordering him to pay $5 million in damages ([Trump reported $700 million of business income, hundreds of millions in debt, on latest financial disclosure - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/trump-reported-700-million-of-business-income-hundreds-of-millions-in-debt-on-latest-financial-disclosure/#:~:text=Trump%20reported%20at%20least%20%24346,over%20%2450%20million%20loan%20related)). Trump has appealed (and faces a second Carroll defamation lawsuit seeking additional damages), but in the interim he was required to post a bond or otherwise account for this judgment – which appears on his financial disclosure as a liability ([Trump reported $700 million of business income, hundreds of millions in debt, on latest financial disclosure - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/trump-reported-700-million-of-business-income-hundreds-of-millions-in-debt-on-latest-financial-disclosure/#:~:text=Trump%20reported%20at%20least%20%24346,over%20%2450%20million%20loan%20related)). Trump also reached a settlement in 2022 with a group of protesters who alleged his security assaulted them in 2015 (terms undisclosed), avoiding a civil trial that could have led to punitive damages. Meanwhile, his longstanding IRS audit of the Trump Foundation’s taxes became moot after he agreed in late 2019 to shut down the charity amid a civil settlement for misuse of funds. 

On the horizon, the most threatening financial legal outcome is the NY AG’s fraud case, given its $250 million penalty request and potential to strip Trump of control of key assets. Combined with mounting legal bills (addressed below) and back tax disputes, Trump faces a constellation of legal and tax matters that could significantly impact his wealth. Thus far, he has managed to delay or outsource many of these costs (for instance, using PAC funds for legal fees), but the eventual resolutions – from court-ordered payments to IRS rulings – pose serious **downside risks to Trump’s finances** in the coming years.

## Political & Business Overlaps 
Trump’s political activities and business interests have become deeply enmeshed, with money flowing in ways that often **benefit his own enterprises**. One clear pattern is **political committees spending donor funds at Trump-owned properties**, effectively converting political contributions into private revenue. During the 2022–24 election cycle, more than **$1.8 million has been spent at Trump properties by campaigns and PACs** ([Political spending tops $1.8 million at Trump properties this cycle - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/political-spending-tops-1-8-million-at-trump-properties-this-cycle/#:~:text=Campaigns%20and%20political%20groups%20have,have%20spent%20more%20than%20%24256%2C000)). Trump’s own political operation accounts for the bulk of this: his campaign, affiliated joint fundraising committees, and Super PACs have paid about **$1.22 million to Trump properties** for event space, catering, lodging, and rent ([Political spending tops $1.8 million at Trump properties this cycle - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/political-spending-tops-1-8-million-at-trump-properties-this-cycle/#:~:text=As%20Trump%20faced%20financial%20pressures,Great%20Again%2C%20Again%21%20spent%20%2414%2C399)). For example, Trump’s 2024 campaign alone spent nearly $380,000 at his venues, and the Trump Save America Joint Fundraising Committee spent about $480,000 ([Political spending tops $1.8 million at Trump properties this cycle - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/political-spending-tops-1-8-million-at-trump-properties-this-cycle/#:~:text=fundraising%20committees%20and%20super%20PACs,Great%20Again%2C%20Again%21%20spent%20%2414%2C399)). Even Trump’s smaller PACs (Make America Great Again PAC, Save America PAC, etc.) together spent over $180,000 at Trump businesses in this period ([Political spending tops $1.8 million at Trump properties this cycle - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/political-spending-tops-1-8-million-at-trump-properties-this-cycle/#:~:text=fundraising%20committees%20and%20super%20PACs,Great%20Again%2C%20Again%21%20spent%20%2414%2C399)). Much of this spending is concentrated at **Mar-a-Lago** in Florida – dubbed the “White House in exile” – which has hosted countless fundraisers, donor dinners, and GOP galas ([Political spending tops $1.8 million at Trump properties this cycle - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/political-spending-tops-1-8-million-at-trump-properties-this-cycle/#:~:text=Despite%20the%20Trump%20Organization%E2%80%99s%20sale,%E2%80%9D)). After Trump sold his DC hotel in 2022 (formerly a favorite venue for conservative groups), Republicans shifted their events to Mar-a-Lago, ensuring Trump still profits from venue rentals ([Political spending tops $1.8 million at Trump properties this cycle - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/political-spending-tops-1-8-million-at-trump-properties-this-cycle/#:~:text=Despite%20the%20Trump%20Organization%E2%80%99s%20sale,%E2%80%9D)). It’s not only Trump’s committees: various GOP candidates have flocked to Trump resorts to seek his favor and draw MAGA donors. Notably, Senate candidates like Ohio’s Bernie Moreno and Arizona’s Kari Lake each spent over $100,000 at Mar-a-Lago for fundraising events ([Political spending tops $1.8 million at Trump properties this cycle - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/political-spending-tops-1-8-million-at-trump-properties-this-cycle/#:~:text=Senate%20candidates%20in%20several%20states,36%2C150%20at%20Trump%20properties%20respectively)). This trend, ongoing since 2017, has been criticized by watchdogs as an ongoing **“self-enrichment” scheme** – effectively Trump has monetized Republican politics by blurring the line between campaign activity and patronizing his private business ([Trump PAC Pays $37K Rent at Trump Tower](https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2021/09/03/trump-pac-a-key-tenant-at-strained-trump-tower/#:~:text=Rent%20isn%E2%80%99t%20the%20only%20payment,being%20closed%2C%20the%20Post%20reported)) ([Trump PAC Pays $37K Rent at Trump Tower](https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2021/09/03/trump-pac-a-key-tenant-at-strained-trump-tower/#:~:text=The%20Trump%20Organization%20occupies%20two,occupancy%20rate%20in%20eight%20years)).

Another major overlap is Trump’s use of **political funds to cover personal legal expenses and staff**. His leadership PAC, **Save America**, became a vehicle to pay tens of millions in legal bills arising from investigations and lawsuits. In 2023 alone, Save America **spent about $59.5 million on legal consulting** for Trump and his associates ([Trump’s super PAC has helped foot his legal bills. That might end soon. - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/20/trump-legal-fees-spending-00153508#:~:text=A%20PAC%20controlled%20by%20former,on%20legal%20fees%20in%20March)) ([Trump’s super PAC has helped foot his legal bills. That might end soon. - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/20/trump-legal-fees-spending-00153508#:~:text=Save%20America%2C%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20leadership%20PAC%2C,York%20criminal%20hush%20money%20trial)). This includes payments to law firms defending Trump in cases like the New York criminal indictment and the federal Mar-a-Lago documents case. In fact, in some months, Save America’s legal outlays have rivaled or exceeded Trump’s own campaign spending ([Trump’s super PAC has helped foot his legal bills. That might end soon. - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/20/trump-legal-fees-spending-00153508#:~:text=in%20March%2C%20according%20to%20a,York%20criminal%20hush%20money%20trial)). By March 2024, the PAC was running low on cash – it even incurred nearly $900,000 in new debt for legal bills that month ([Trump’s super PAC has helped foot his legal bills. That might end soon. - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/20/trump-legal-fees-spending-00153508#:~:text=A%20PAC%20controlled%20by%20former,on%20legal%20fees%20in%20March)) ([Trump’s super PAC has helped foot his legal bills.

To sustain the fund, Trump’s affiliated Super PAC (Make America Great Again Inc.) has been back-transferring money to Save America – $5 million per month through late 2023 – essentially refunding earlier contributions to keep up with legal fees ([Trump’s super PAC has helped foot his legal bills. That might end soon. - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/20/trump-legal-fees-spending-00153508#:~:text=Save%20America%2C%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20leadership%20PAC%2C,less%20regular%20transfers%20before%20then)). This creative shuffling raised questions with the FEC, since Save America initially seeded MAGA Inc. with $60 million before Trump declared his 2024 candidacy ([Trump’s super PAC has helped foot his legal bills. That might end soon. - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/20/trump-legal-fees-spending-00153508#:~:text=Trump,less%20regular%20transfers%20before%20then)). As of mid-2024, that $60 million has nearly all been cycled back to pay lawyers, prompting concerns about how Trump will fund future legal battles once that well runs dry ([Trump’s super PAC has helped foot his legal bills. That might end soon. - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/20/trump-legal-fees-spending-00153508#:~:text=before%20then)). Ethically, Trump’s heavy reliance on donor money for personal litigation pushes the bounds of campaign finance rules – it’s legally permissible for leadership PACs, but it has drawn criticism that donors funding “election defense” or policy causes are instead bankrolling Trump’s private court fights.

Trump also **directly intertwines campaign operations with his businesses**. His official campaign headquarters for 2024 is in his own office building in Arlington, VA, but he maintains a political office in Trump Tower, NYC – for which his PAC pays **$37,500 in monthly rent** ([Trump PAC Pays $37K Rent at Trump Tower](https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2021/09/03/trump-pac-a-key-tenant-at-strained-trump-tower/#:~:text=As%20other%20tenants%20have%20racked,according%20to%20the%20Washington%20Post)). Notably, this Trump Tower space housed only a skeleton staff (as few as 3 employees in 2021) ([Trump PAC Pays $37K Rent at Trump Tower](https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2021/09/03/trump-pac-a-key-tenant-at-strained-trump-tower/#:~:text=headquarters,the%20floor%20is%20vacant)), suggesting the PAC was paying above-market rent for mostly unused space – effectively a retainer to keep cash flowing to Trump Org. The PAC even paid $3,000 a month for a kiosk in the Tower’s empty lobby, “renting” an unused space ([Trump PAC Pays $37K Rent at Trump Tower](https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2021/09/03/trump-pac-a-key-tenant-at-strained-trump-tower/#:~:text=Rent%20isn%E2%80%99t%20the%20only%20payment,being%20closed%2C%20the%20Post%20reported)). Watchdog groups flagged these payments as problematic, labeling them a “con” to enrich Trump under the guise of political expense ([Trump PAC Pays $37K Rent at Trump Tower](https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2021/09/03/trump-pac-a-key-tenant-at-strained-trump-tower/#:~:text=The%20payments%20may%20not%20be,but%20they%20are%20drawing%20scrutiny)). In another example, Trump’s campaigns routinely **charter Trump’s private aircraft or use Trump-owned venues** for rallies, then reimburse those costs. For instance, in the 2020 campaign and continuing into 2024, Trump’s committees have paid his own aviation company and properties for services – all legitimate expenses, but money ultimately back into Trump’s pocket. During his presidency, this dynamic extended to the government as well, with Secret Service and officials paying room and golf cart fees at Trump resorts (over $1.1 million of government funds flowed to Trump’s businesses by one count). All of this led to unprecedented **conflicts of interest**, where policy decisions or patronage could be seen as tied to Trump’s financial interests. Members of Congress and foreign diplomats were well aware that **spending money at Trump’s hotel or club was a way to ingratiate themselves** – a dynamic the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause was designed to prevent ([Political spending tops $1.8 million at Trump properties this cycle - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/political-spending-tops-1-8-million-at-trump-properties-this-cycle/#:~:text=Political%20spending%20at%20Trump%20properties,political%20events%20at%20the%20properties)) ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=including%20swords%20and%20daggers,51)).

In summary, Trump has effectively **merged his fundraising and business**, using political contributions to buoy his companies and using his properties to generate political contributions. This symbiosis keeps cash flowing within the Trump ecosystem: Donors fund PACs → PACs spend at Trump businesses or on Trump’s lawyers → the money benefits Trump personally or bolsters his assets. While Trump is hardly the first politician to hold campaign events at his own properties, the **scale and centrality** of such transactions in Trump’s operation is unprecedented. It raises ongoing questions about donor intent, fiduciary duty, and whether Trump’s 2024 run is fueled as much by the pursuit of profit and legal protection as it is by politics. Thus far, however, regulators have not taken action to curb these practices, and Trump’s core base of supporters doesn’t appear deterred by how their contributions are being used.

## Post-Presidency Ventures and Shifts in Strategy
After leaving office, Trump embarked on several new ventures and adjustments aimed at **monetizing his post-presidential brand** and positioning himself for a potential return to power. A centerpiece of his efforts was the creation of **Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG)**, the parent of the social network **Truth Social**. Launched in February 2022, Truth Social was intended as a free-speech MAGA-friendly alternative to Twitter. Trump invested his name and image heavily – he owns about 90% of TMTG’s stock – but the platform’s performance has **struggled to meet expectations**. As of early 2024, Truth Social’s user base and traffic remain modest. The site averaged only around **4–5 million total monthly visits in the U.S.** (by comparison, Twitter/X sees billions), and its growth has plateaued ([DJT: Truth Social struggles to grow U.S. user base - CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/24/truth-social-traffic-trump-media-djt-data.html#:~:text=DJT%3A%20Truth%20Social%20struggles%20to,from)) ([30 Truth Social Statistics 2025: Number of Users - Demand Sage](https://www.demandsage.com/truth-social-statistics/#:~:text=Comparatively%2C%20the%20platform%20witnessed%20traffic,average%20duration%20of%20visit)). In fact, from May 2023 to April 2024, Truth Social’s web traffic was down nearly 40% year-over-year ([DJT: Truth Social struggles to grow U.S. user base - CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/24/truth-social-traffic-trump-media-djt-data.html#:~:text=DJT%3A%20Truth%20Social%20struggles%20to,from)), indicating waning engagement. Internal financials paint an even starker picture: TMTG disclosed only **$1.7 million in revenue for the first half of 2024** (combined $770k in Q1 and $837k in Q2) ([Truth Social - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social#:~:text=In%20May%202024%2C%20TMTG%20disclosed,174)). Against that, the company incurred over $28 million in operating losses for the same first half of 2024 ([Truth Social - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social#:~:text=In%20May%202024%2C%20TMTG%20disclosed,174)). For full-year 2023, filings showed roughly **$4.1 million in revenue and $58 million in net losses** for Trump’s media company ([Trump's Truth Social lost $58 million in 2023 - Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/04/01/trump-truth-social-revenue-2023#:~:text=Trump%27s%20Truth%20Social%20lost%20%2458,according%20to%20new%20SEC%20filings)). These losses have been financed by private investors and the expectation of a large capital infusion via a merger with a SPAC (Digital World Acquisition Corp.).

The planned **SPAC merger** has been a saga unto itself. Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC) announced in late 2021 it would merge with TMTG to take it public and provide $1.3 billion in cash. However, almost immediately the deal came under **investigation by the SEC and federal prosecutors** over potential illegal pre-merger coordination. A federal grand jury issued subpoenas in mid-2022 and the SEC delayed approval of the merger, putting Truth Social’s funding in jeopardy ([Truth Social - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social#:~:text=In%20June%202022%2C%20federal%20regulators,177)). DWAC had to repeatedly extend its deadline as it awaited regulatory clearance. In July 2023, DWAC’s sponsor agreed to an $18 million settlement with the SEC for filing misleading information (though not admitting fraud), clearing a major hurdle ([Truth Social - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social#:~:text=In%20June%202022%2C%20federal%20regulators,3%20billion%20from%20Digital)). By **February 2024, the SEC finally approved the DWAC-TMTG merger registration** ([Truth Social - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social#:~:text=In%20June%202023%2C%20U,184)), and in March 2024 DWAC shareholders voted to consummate the deal ([Truth Social - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social#:~:text=On%20February%2015%2C%202024%2C%20the,187)). This was a double-edged sword: on one hand, Trump’s stake in the merged entity (anticipated ticker: $DJT) briefly had a sky-high paper valuation – **Bloomberg estimated Trump’s net worth jumped by $4 billion, to $6.5 billion, after the merger news** ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=In%20March%202024%2C%20when%20Trump,130)). On the other hand, DWAC’s stock price fell sharply after the vote, and observers noted that due to lock-up rules and low liquidity, it would be difficult for Trump to quickly cash out his shares ([Truth Social - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social#:~:text=On%20February%2015%2C%202024%2C%20the,187)). Indeed, by August 2024, the market value of TMTG had dropped over 65% from its peak, bringing Trump’s net worth back down to an estimated $4.3 billion ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=company%20to%20around%2065,)). As of March 2025, the merger has closed and TMTG is technically public, but **Trump has not sold any stock** ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=The%20value%20of%20TMTG%20decreased,131)). If Truth Social does not dramatically improve its financials, the company could burn through the SPAC cash, meaning Trump’s paper gains might not translate to real wealth. In the meantime, Trump has an exclusivity agreement (recently lapsed) that required him to post on Truth Social six hours before any other social media. This kept him off Twitter and Facebook for much of 2022–2023, arguably limiting Truth Social’s reach by siloing his content. (He did return to Twitter/X briefly in August 2023 to post his Georgia mugshot, once the exclusivity expired.)

Aside from Truth Social, Trump’s **post-presidency business strategy** has emphasized **licensing and branding ventures over direct investment**. The partnership in Oman for a luxury resort is one example, as are new deals announced in 2023 to attach the Trump name to real estate projects in **Saudi Arabia and the UAE** ([Trump reported $700 million of business income, hundreds of millions in debt, on latest financial disclosure - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/trump-reported-700-million-of-business-income-hundreds-of-millions-in-debt-on-latest-financial-disclosure/#:~:text=Trump%20took%20in%20over%20%2415,the%20UAE%20announced%20last%20month)). These deals often require little or no capital from Trump but promise future fees. They also leverage Trump’s political connections – it is no coincidence that Gulf state developers are eager to work with him given his friendly stance toward those regimes while in office ([Saudi Arabia's Dar Al Arkan signs deal with Trump family for Oman project | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/saudi-arabias-dar-al-arkan-signs-deal-with-trump-family-oman-project-2022-11-20/#:~:text=Trump%20had%20handed%20control%20of,his%20sons%20while%20in%20office)). Domestically, Trump has not opened new properties under his name since leaving office, and even shelved earlier plans (e.g. the “Scion” hotel line never launched). Instead, the Trump Organization focused on **managing existing assets and improving profitability**. Hosting the LIV Golf tour events at Trump courses in 2022 and 2023 is a prime example: it brought in hefty event fees and publicity, essentially replacing the PGA events Trump lost after January 6th ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=Following%20the%20storming%20of%20the,the%20Trump%20Golf%20Links%20at)). Likewise, Mar-a-Lago’s pivot to a political events center kept it booked with banquets and conferences, mitigating any loss of traditional social members who quit after the Capitol riot ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=The%20real%20estate%20firm%20Cushman,60)).

Trump also explored novel ways to raise money from his supporter base outside of campaign donations. The **Trump Digital Trading Cards (NFTs)** proved surprisingly successful – selling 44,000 tokens at $99 each in the first series (December 2022) and another 38,000 in a second series (April 2023) ([Trump reported $700 million of business income, hundreds of millions in debt, on latest financial disclosure - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/trump-reported-700-million-of-business-income-hundreds-of-millions-in-debt-on-latest-financial-disclosure/#:~:text=Trump%E2%80%99s%20DC%2C%20Miami%20and%20Bedminster%2C,million%20and%20%2437%20million%2C%20respectively)). These NFT sales not only put a few million dollars in Trump’s pocket, but also kept his fans engaged with his persona (each NFT is a caricature of Trump in heroic poses). Additionally, Trump’s campaign website began selling merchandise like T-shirts, posters (e.g. of his mugshot with “Never Surrender”), and even **a commemorative book of letters**, all of which generate revenue that, while earmarked for campaign, ultimately sustain his political brand. It’s worth noting that Trump’s personal **net worth** has fluctuated with these ventures. Forbes estimated his wealth at **$2.6 billion in October 2023**, down from earlier years largely because the perceived value of Truth Social plummeted by over $600 million ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=On%20October%203%2C%202023%2C%20Forbes,361%2C%20has%20about%20%2420)). The resurgence to over $4–6 billion in early 2024 was tied to the anticipated SPAC windfall ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=In%20March%202024%2C%20when%20Trump,130)), illustrating how much Trump’s fortune is now leveraged to his post-presidential media company’s fate.

In summary, since 2022 Donald Trump has **retooled his financial strategy** in several ways: 
- **Asset Optimization:** Selling underperforming or controversy-laden assets (like the D.C. hotel and Bronx golf course) to raise cash and reduce debt, while doubling down on profitable properties (Florida clubs, etc.). 
- **Brand Globalization:** Signing overseas deals (Oman, potentially Saudi and elsewhere) to earn fees from the Trump name without major new investments, capitalizing on political goodwill abroad. 
- **Media & Technology Play:** Attempting to create a social media platform to rival Twitter – a high-risk, high-reward gambit that so far has produced more losses than gains, but which could yield enormous wealth if successful. 
- **Monetizing Fame:** Launching consumer products (books, NFTs, branded memorabilia) that turn his celebrity into direct income from his follower base. 
- **Political War Chest:** Relying on political fundraising not just for campaign-related expenses but as a quasi-business subsidy (covering legal costs and generating events income for his properties). 

This hybrid political-business approach is unprecedented for a former president, but it reflects Trump’s unique situation and skill set. By intertwining his political brand with his businesses, Trump has managed to **keep his enterprises solvent and even thriving** in some areas, despite the reputational hits of the past and ongoing legal troubles. However, this also means his financial fortunes are heavily tied to his political future. A return to the White House could further boost his businesses (through prestige and patronage), whereas a definitive political end or major legal defeat could strain his finances. As of March 2025, Trump’s financial condition appears robust in terms of assets and income flow – he remains a billionaire with myriad revenue sources – but it is also **highly leveraged and contingent** on both the legal outcomes ahead and the continued loyalty of those willing to pay for the Trump name.
