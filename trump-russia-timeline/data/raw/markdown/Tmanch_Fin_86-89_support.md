**Introduction:** Donald Trump’s late-1980s business dealings were marked by rapid expansion, flashy acquisitions, and heavy borrowing – a formula that boosted his public profile but sowed the seeds of financial trouble ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=months%20with%20game,his%20four%20corporate%20bankruptcy%20filings)) ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=That%20spring%2C%20though%2C%20he%20purchased,debt%20to%20which%20Trump%20committed)). During 1986–1989, Trump added casinos, hotels, an airline, and even a megayacht to his empire, often financing them with **massive loans and high-interest debt**. Insiders later noted that Trump was “just buying up things with loans,” driven by “insatiable” ambition, a pattern that would catch up with him by 1990 ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=%E2%80%9CHe%20was%20just%20buying%20up,%E2%80%9D)). The following report examines key players in Trump’s finances during 1986–89, his major acquisitions, international ties, legal scrutiny, financial red flags, and the contrast between his public boasts and behind-the-scenes reality.

During this period, he aggressively expanded his business empire – from Manhattan real estate to Atlantic City casinos – largely by leveraging debt and courting publicity.* ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=months%20with%20game,his%20four%20corporate%20bankruptcy%20filings)) ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=That%20spring%2C%20though%2C%20he%20purchased,debt%20to%20which%20Trump%20committed))

## 1. Key Individuals and Entities (1986–1989)  
- **Business Partners & Associates:** Trump often operated through partnerships or high-profile negotiations. In Atlantic City, he initially partnered with **Holiday Corporation (Harrah’s)** to build his first casino (Trump Plaza) in 1984, securing a deal highly favorable to him ([The Rise and Fall of Donald Trump's Atlantic City Empire](https://www.phillymag.com/city/2015/08/16/donald-trump-atlantic-city-empire/#:~:text=too%2C%20basically%20getting%20Holiday%20Inn,%E2%80%9CThis%20was%20difficult)). His then-wife **Ivana Trump** managed the Trump Castle casino, and confidantes like **Barbara Res** (a Trump Organization VP) helped oversee construction projects ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=%E2%80%9CHe%20was%20just%20buying%20up,%E2%80%9D)). A major figure in this period was **Merv Griffin**, the entertainment magnate who battled Trump for control of Resorts International (owner of the half-built Taj Mahal casino). In 1988, Griffin launched a rival bid, ultimately striking a settlement that gave **Griffin** control of Resorts International and gave **Trump** the Taj Mahal (in exchange for Trump paying around $300 million and surrendering a management fee) ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=In%20April%2C%20Merv%20Griffin%20got,to%20an%20account%20in%20the)) ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=Griffin%20to%20get%20the%20rest,in%20the%20press%20for%20the)). Trump’s aging lawyer and mentor **Roy Cohn** (who died in 1986) had also been a key associate, though by the late ’80s Trump was relying on other attorneys for his ventures.  

- **Lenders and Financial Institutions:** Trump’s expansion was bankrolled by a network of banks and junk-bond investors. **Citicorp (Citibank)** led a syndicate that financed Trump’s 1988 purchase of the Plaza Hotel with a **$300 million mortgage plus a $125 million loan**, ultimately taking a 49% equity stake due to the deal’s shaky performance ([Banking on the Donald. | American Banker](https://www.americanbanker.com/news/banking-on-the-donald#:~:text=Citi%20led%20a%20%24300%20million,the%20Plaza%20posted%20in%201993)). A **consortium of 17 banks** (with Citibank participating) provided about **$245 million in loans** for Trump’s 1989 purchase of the Eastern Air Shuttle (later “Trump Shuttle”) ([Banking on the Donald. | American Banker](https://www.americanbanker.com/news/banking-on-the-donald#:~:text=Citicorp%27s%20other%20big%20Trump,payments%20on%20the%20shuttle%20mortgage)). For the Taj Mahal, Trump turned to **high-yield (“junk”) bonds** and short-term bank loans: e.g. **First Fidelity Bank** lent $78 million in 1989 for Taj construction, and **NatWest (National Westminster Bank)** lent $55 million to furnish the casino ([Banking on the Donald. | American Banker](https://www.americanbanker.com/news/banking-on-the-donald#:~:text=First%20Fidelity%2C%20which%20lent%20Mr,if%20the%20offering%20goes%20off)). **Bear Stearns** investment bank facilitated Trump’s forays into stock acquisitions (buying large blocks of company shares on his behalf) ([News Release](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cases/1988/04/880405trumppressrelease.pdf#:~:text=HE%20VIOLATED%20PREMERGER%20NOTIFICATION%20REQillREMENTS,requirements%20when%20he%20acquired%20stock)) ([News Release](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cases/1988/04/880405trumppressrelease.pdf#:~:text=The%20complaint%20charges%20that%2C%20in,based%20in%20New%20York%20City)). Trump’s father, **Fred C. Trump**, did not directly co-own ventures but quietly assisted at times (in one instance, family funds were used to purchase casino chips to bolster Trump’s cash reserves, an issue that arose in 1990). Major accounting and law firms (and figures like CFO Stephen Bollenbach in 1990) were pulled in as Trump’s finances grew complex.  

- **Regulatory and Oversight Agencies:** Trump’s ventures brought him under the eye of several regulators. The **New Jersey Casino Control Commission** and the **Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE)** vetted his Atlantic City casino licenses. He was ultimately licensed, but regulators noted concerns – for example, in 1988 some NJ casino commissioners felt Trump’s maneuvers to gain the Taj Mahal were “fishy,” calling his testimony *“laced with hyperbole, contradictions and generalities,”* although they grudgingly approved the deal ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=lowball%20bid%20of%20%2415%20a,out%20scheme%20by)). The **Federal Trade Commission (FTC)** and **Department of Justice** scrutinized Trump’s aggressive stock purchases; in 1988 he was charged with violating **Hart-Scott-Rodino Act** pre-merger disclosure rules (for stealthily acquiring large stakes in Holiday Corp. and Bally) ([News Release](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cases/1988/04/880405trumppressrelease.pdf#:~:text=HE%20VIOLATED%20PREMERGER%20NOTIFICATION%20REQillREMENTS,requirements%20when%20he%20acquired%20stock)) ([News Release](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cases/1988/04/880405trumppressrelease.pdf#:~:text=The%20complaint%20charges%20that%2C%20in,based%20in%20New%20York%20City)). Trump agreed to pay a **$750,000 civil penalty** to settle those charges ([News Release](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cases/1988/04/880405trumppressrelease.pdf#:~:text=HE%20VIOLATED%20PREMERGER%20NOTIFICATION%20REQillREMENTS,requirements%20when%20he%20acquired%20stock)) ([News Release](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cases/1988/04/880405trumppressrelease.pdf#:~:text=The%20complaint%20charges%20that%2C%20in,based%20in%20New%20York%20City)). Additionally, the **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)** monitored his “corporate raider” activities, and local authorities (e.g. New York City agencies) dealt with Trump on zoning, tax abatements, and tenant relations in his real estate holdings. In short, by the late ’80s Trump’s business orbit included investment bankers, big lenders, high-profile partners, and wary regulators.

## 2. Real Estate and Business Acquisitions (1986–1989)  
Trump’s appetite for acquisitions in 1986–89 was enormous. He dramatically expanded his casino-hotels portfolio in Atlantic City, bought one of New York’s most famous hotels, ventured into the airline industry, and snapped up various other assets – often at record-setting prices:

- **Atlantic City Casinos:** By 1986, Trump already owned two casinos in Atlantic City – **Trump Plaza** (opened 1984 in partnership with Holiday Corp) and **Trump’s Castle** (acquired by Trump in 1985 after Hilton Hotels failed to get a casino license). Not content, Trump set his sights on a third, much larger casino: the **Taj Mahal**. In 1987–1988, he quietly began buying shares of **Resorts International**, the company building the Taj. A fierce takeover battle with Merv Griffin ensued, lasting months ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=months%20with%20game,his%20four%20corporate%20bankruptcy%20filings)). By November 1988, Trump struck a deal to acquire the **unfinished Taj Mahal** – a gargantuan, over-budget project – while Griffin took over Resorts’ other properties ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=In%20April%2C%20Merv%20Griffin%20got,to%20an%20account%20in%20the)) ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=Griffin%20to%20get%20the%20rest,in%20the%20press%20for%20the)). Trump trumpeted the Taj as the world’s biggest casino and envisioned it as the crown jewel of his empire. He financed its construction and opening (scheduled for 1990) largely with debt, including **$675 million in 14% interest bonds** ([Trump casino empire dogged by bad bets in Atlantic City](https://www.newscentermaine.com/article/news/nation-now/trump-casino-empire-dogged-by-bad-bets-in-atlantic-city/97-264767870#:~:text=City%20www,The)). The Taj Mahal purchase gave Trump control of “the most expensive casino ever built,” but also a property that would struggle under the weight of its financing. (Indeed, the **Taj opened in April 1990 and filed for bankruptcy by late 1991**, unable to pay its crushing debt – an outcome seeded by the 1988 deal ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=months%20with%20game,his%20four%20corporate%20bankruptcy%20filings)).) During this period, Trump also expanded Trump Plaza in AC and floated ideas for adjacent attractions (from a theme park on Steel Pier to the “world’s largest yacht” docked at his marina) – though many such plans never materialized ([The Rise and Fall of Donald Trump's Atlantic City Empire](https://www.phillymag.com/city/2015/08/16/donald-trump-atlantic-city-empire/#:~:text=casinos%20that%20looked%20like%20gaudy,of%20these%20planned%20projects%C2%A0ever%20happened)) ([The Rise and Fall of Donald Trump's Atlantic City Empire](https://www.phillymag.com/city/2015/08/16/donald-trump-atlantic-city-empire/#:~:text=Pier%3A%20First%20a%20Six%20Flags%2C,of%20these%20planned%20projects%C2%A0ever%20happened)). 

- **The Plaza Hotel (New York City):** In March 1988, Trump made headlines by purchasing Manhattan’s iconic **Plaza Hotel**. He openly coveted this landmark and ended up paying **$407.5 million** – at the time, *the highest price ever for a hotel* ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=That%20spring%2C%20though%2C%20he%20purchased,debt%20to%20which%20Trump%20committed)). Observers noted this price was about 25× the Plaza’s annual cash flow, an extraordinarily rich valuation ([Forbes: Plaza lost $100 million in 2 years - UPI Archives](https://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/06/23/Forbes-Plaza-lost-100-million-in-2-years/2698677649600/#:~:text=Forbes%3A%20Plaza%20lost%20%24100%20million,If%20the%20banks%20foreclosed)). Trump admitted he didn’t do much “lengthy financial analysis” before buying – he simply wanted the trophy asset ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20price%20was%20too%20high%2C%E2%80%9D,%E2%80%99)). To fund the deal, Trump put in only a token amount of equity (around $20 million) and borrowed the rest: a consortium led by Citibank provided about **$380 million in loans** ([Abraham Wallach Book Excerpt: The Plaza Hotel Chapter - 27 East](https://www.27east.com/real-estate-news/abraham-wallach-book-excerpt-the-plaza-hotel-chapter-1395774/#:~:text=Abraham%20Wallach%20Book%20Excerpt%3A%20The,in%20about%20%2420%20million%2C)). Trump installed his wife **Ivana** as President of the Plaza Hotel and announced plans to “upgrade” it into the world’s most luxurious hotel ([Vote In Or Out on Instagram: "In July 1987, #DonaldTrump, then 41 ...](https://www.instagram.com/voteinorout/p/DG8yGKORfZz/#:~:text=Vote%20In%20Or%20Out%20on,secured%20loans%20from%20a)). However, the Plaza’s profits could *not* even cover the interest on Trump’s debt ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=That%20spring%2C%20though%2C%20he%20purchased,debt%20to%20which%20Trump%20committed)). Within two years, the Plaza was losing money (nearly $100 million lost by 1990), forcing Trump to concede 49% ownership to his lenders in a 1992 restructuring ([Trump Organization: Corporate Rap Sheet | Corporate Research Project](https://www.corp-research.org/trump-organization#:~:text=Trump%2C%20who%20was%20bumped%20from,in%20the%20Grand%20Hyatt%20in)). The Plaza purchase epitomized Trump’s 1980s style: bold and news-making, but highly leveraged and financially precarious.

- **Trump Shuttle (Airline):** In 1989, Trump ventured into aviation by acquiring the **Eastern Air Lines Shuttle**, a no-frills air service flying the New York–DC–Boston corridor. He agreed to buy the shuttle in late 1988 for **$365 million** and rebranded it as **Trump Shuttle** ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=And%20in%20the%20fall%2C%20he,thought%20the%20shuttle%20was%20worth)). The deal included 21 aging Boeing 727 airplanes and the shuttle’s landing slots/gates. Even here, Trump’s penchant for overpaying showed: industry analysts and even Eastern’s own CEO Frank Lorenzo felt Trump paid a premium price ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=And%20in%20the%20fall%2C%20he,thought%20the%20shuttle%20was%20worth)) ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20price%20was%20too%20high%2C%E2%80%9D,%E2%80%99)). (“Our number was $375–385 million…and he negotiated it down to $365M. …Your offering price is always higher than what you think you’ll get – he almost got it anyway,” Lorenzo quipped ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20went%20to%20him%2C%E2%80%9D%20Frank,he%20almost%20got%20it%2C%20anyway)).) Trump spent lavishly to refurbish the planes with gold-colored “Trump” logos, maple-wood veneer cabin accents and other luxuries ([Whatever happened to Trump Shuttle Inc? - Ishka](https://www.ishkaglobal.com/News/Article/5521/Whatever-happened-to-Trump-Shuttle-Inc#:~:text=Whatever%20happened%20to%20Trump%20Shuttle,For%20reference%2C%20his%20team)). The **Trump Shuttle** launched in June 1989 amid much publicity. However, like many Trump ventures, it was highly leveraged – backed by a large bank syndicate – and struggled to turn a profit in a competitive airline market. (By 1992, Trump defaulted and surrendered the shuttle to his banks; it was eventually absorbed into USAir ([Trump Organization: Corporate Rap Sheet | Corporate Research Project](https://www.corp-research.org/trump-organization#:~:text=investment%20in%20Bally%20and%20another,in%20Holiday%20Corp)).) The shuttle purchase, while bolstering Trump’s image as a global business mogul, added to his growing debt load.

- **Other Ventures:** Trump’s 1986–89 shopping spree extended to other realms. He purchased the world’s then-third-largest yacht – the 282-foot **Trump Princess** (formerly *Nabila*, owned by Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi) – for about **$29 million** in 1987 ([Kingdom 5KR - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_5KR#:~:text=After%20Khashoggi%20ran%20into%20financial,accomplished%20in%20only%20a%20couple)). He immediately poured millions more into refurbishing the superyacht to fit his style, and it became a floating symbol of 1980s extravagance. In New York, Trump acquired several residential and commercial properties: he converted an old Barbizon hotel into **Trump Parc** luxury condos on Central Park South (opened 1987) and started construction of **Trump Palace** (a high-rise condo on 69th Street) in 1988. He also assembled a 76-acre parcel on Manhattan’s West Side (the former rail yards) for a proposed “Television City” development – later renamed **Trump City** – where he envisioned building the world’s tallest building ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=In%20the%20first%20three%20months,Beach%2C%20Florida%2C%20to%20lower%20the)). (That project faced community opposition and would not be realized as originally planned.) During this period Trump even toyed with buying an NFL team (the New England Patriots) and a media outlet (the New York Post), and he snapped up stakes in companies outside real estate: for example, he bought significant shares of **Federated Department Stores** and **MCA (Music Corporation of America)** in 1988, fueling rumors he might launch takeovers ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=In%20the%20first%20three%20months,Beach%2C%20Florida%2C%20to%20lower%20the)). In most cases, these investments were short-lived or purely speculative. As one publication noted, *“in the late 1980s Trump became a corporate raider,”* often buying into companies and then selling for a quick profit when the stock price rose ([Trump Organization: Corporate Rap Sheet | Corporate Research Project](https://www.corp-research.org/trump-organization#:~:text=In%20the%20late%201980s%20Trump,federal%20judge%20sanctioned%20the%20deal)). Indeed, Trump made money in 1987–88 by accumulating stock in companies like **Bally Manufacturing** (a casino company) and **Holiday Corp.** (hotel chain), then forcing management to buy back his shares at a premium – a tactic critics called **“greenmail.”** ([Trump Organization: Corporate Rap Sheet | Corporate Research Project](https://www.corp-research.org/trump-organization#:~:text=In%20the%20late%201980s%20Trump,federal%20judge%20sanctioned%20the%20deal)) Such maneuvers gave Trump windfall profits without actually managing those businesses. In sum, from 1986 to 1989 Trump was in near-constant acquisition mode – scooping up casinos, landmark properties, an airline, a mega-yacht, and chunks of other companies – an extraordinary expansion financed almost entirely by debt and aimed at cementing his image as the ultimate deal-maker. 

## 3. International Financial Ties  
Although Trump’s core businesses were U.S.-based, from 1986–89 he pursued several international connections and deals: 

- **Soviet Union Dealings:** In July 1987, at the height of glasnost, Trump traveled to Moscow at the invitation of the Soviet government to explore building a luxury hotel. Soviet Ambassador **Yuri Dubinin** and diplomat **Vitaly Churkin** helped arrange Trump’s visit, which included tours of potential hotel sites near Red Square ([The Hidden History of Trump’s First Trip to Moscow - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/19/trump-first-moscow-trip-215842#:~:text=By%20January%201987%2C%20Trump%20was,American%20assistant)) ([The Hidden History of Trump’s First Trip to Moscow - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/19/trump-first-moscow-trip-215842#:~:text=According%20to%20The%20Art%20of,and%20the%20state%20Hermitage%20museum)). Trump and his then-wife Ivana stayed in a Kremlin-owned suite and met with officials from **Goscomintourist** (the Soviet state tourism agency) about a possible joint venture ([The Hidden History of Trump’s First Trip to Moscow - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/19/trump-first-moscow-trip-215842#:~:text=Moscow%20was%2C%20Trump%20wrote%2C%20%E2%80%9Can,suite%20would%20have%20been%20bugged)) ([The Hidden History of Trump’s First Trip to Moscow - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/19/trump-first-moscow-trip-215842#:~:text=According%20to%20The%20Art%20of,and%20the%20state%20Hermitage%20museum)). Trump later wrote that the trip was “an extraordinary experience” and that Soviet officials were “very impressed” and eager to make a deal ([The Hidden History of Trump’s First Trip to Moscow - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/19/trump-first-moscow-trip-215842#:~:text=According%20to%20The%20Art%20of,and%20the%20state%20Hermitage%20museum)). Ultimately, *no Moscow tower materialized in the ’80s*, but this early outreach foreshadowed Trump’s continued interest in Russian projects in the decades to come. Notably, western intelligence observers suspect the Soviet **KGB** orchestrated aspects of Trump’s 1987 visit, viewing him as an influential American businessman to potentially cultivate ([The Hidden History of Trump’s First Trip to Moscow - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/19/trump-first-moscow-trip-215842#:~:text=Trump%27s%20first%20visit%20to%20Soviet,This)) ([The Hidden History of Trump’s First Trip to Moscow - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/19/trump-first-moscow-trip-215842#:~:text=In%20The%20Art%20of%20the,for%20international%20tourism%2C%20Goscomintourist%2C%20had)). While concrete business didn’t result, the trip indicates Trump was seeking foreign partnerships and wasn’t shy about dealing with a communist government to expand his brand globally.  

- **Japanese and Other Foreign Investors:** The late 1980s saw a boom of Japanese investment in U.S. real estate, and Trump did have interactions with foreign banks. For example, in 1989 **NatWest (UK)** and **First Fidelity (US/NJ)** banks provided loans for his Taj Mahal casino ([Banking on the Donald. | American Banker](https://www.americanbanker.com/news/banking-on-the-donald#:~:text=First%20Fidelity%2C%20which%20lent%20Mr,if%20the%20offering%20goes%20off)), and **European and Asian banks** participated in his property loan syndicates. However, Trump’s direct ties to Japanese firms during 1986–89 were limited – he did not consummate any major joint ventures with Japanese developers, even as he observed them buying iconic assets like Rockefeller Center (which Trump himself mused about). In fact, Trump often displayed an ambivalent stance: he publicly criticized Japanese economic practices (arguing Japan had an unfair trade advantage over the U.S.), even as he courted international capital for his projects. There were reports that Japanese investors showed interest in Trump’s West Side Manhattan project, but no deal was struck at the time. Thus, aside from borrowing from some foreign banks, Trump’s business was still primarily financed by American institutions in this period.

- **Middle Eastern Connections:** Trump’s most notable Middle Eastern financial link in the late ’80s came via his yacht purchase. The 282-foot yacht he bought in 1987 had been owned by Saudi billionaire **Adnan Khashoggi**, an international arms dealer. Khashoggi, who was later indicted in the U.S. on fraud and racketeering charges, was known for aiding the Marcos regime in hiding illicit assets ([Khashoggi's Fall | Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/1989/09/dunne198909?srsltid=AfmBOor66ygv3v3kHMB6-aWeZovjp8Fy3mR0H2qaAmD5q0qAfv2c0tsb#:~:text=Allegedly%2C%20he%20helped%20his%20friends,Imelda%20Marcos%20had%20allegedly%20purloined)) ([Khashoggi's Fall | Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/1989/09/dunne198909?srsltid=AfmBOor66ygv3v3kHMB6-aWeZovjp8Fy3mR0H2qaAmD5q0qAfv2c0tsb#:~:text=four%20large%20commercial%20buildings%20in,up)). Trump bought Khashoggi’s lavish yacht (named *Nabila*) when Khashoggi hit financial trouble. The vessel briefly passed through the hands of the **Sultan of Brunei** (another wealthy figure) who then sold it to Trump for about $29 million in 1988 ([Kingdom 5KR - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_5KR#:~:text=After%20Khashoggi%20ran%20into%20financial,accomplished%20in%20only%20a%20couple)). Trump renamed it the **Trump Princess**, symbolically one-upping its former owner. While this was a private sale, it tangentially linked Trump to an international web of wealthy Gulf figures. Beyond the yacht, Trump in 1989 welcomed the first **Middle Eastern royalty and investors** as high-rollers in his Atlantic City casinos and buyers of his condo units. (In one famous later deal just outside our period, in 1991 Trump sold the Trump Princess yacht to Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal to raise cash.) These instances show Trump had begun tapping into Middle Eastern petrodollar wealth when convenient.

- **Attempted International Expansions:** Trump also tried to expand his casino brand abroad. In 1987, he joined a consortium bidding to build the first casino in Sydney, Australia. However, this **Australian venture collapsed** when the New South Wales Police Board raised alarms about Trump’s associations. In a confidential 1987 report, Aussie officials warned that “*Trump’s mafia connections should exclude the Kern/Trump consortium*” from the project ([‘Mafia connections’ halted Trump’s 1987 casino plan - Taipei Times](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2017/09/08/2003678048#:~:text=At%20the%20time%2C%20Trump%20operated,close%20to%20owning%20a%20third)) ([‘Mafia connections’ halted Trump’s 1987 casino plan - Taipei Times](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2017/09/08/2003678048#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAtlantic%20City%20would%20be%20a,report%20dated%20April%203%2C%201987)). The police were concerned about Trump’s Atlantic City background – implying links to organized crime figures in U.S. casinos – and deemed his consortium’s revenue forecasts “not soundly based” ([‘Mafia connections’ halted Trump’s 1987 casino plan - Taipei Times](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2017/09/08/2003678048#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAtlantic%20City%20would%20be%20a,report%20dated%20April%203%2C%201987)) ([‘Mafia connections’ halted Trump’s 1987 casino plan - Taipei Times](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2017/09/08/2003678048#:~:text=The%20documents%20said%20the%20consortium%E2%80%99s,%E2%80%9D)). As a result, Trump’s bid was rejected by the NSW government in May 1987 ([‘Mafia connections’ halted Trump’s 1987 casino plan - Taipei Times](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2017/09/08/2003678048#:~:text=At%20the%20time%2C%20Trump%20operated,close%20to%20owning%20a%20third)). This episode, only made public years later, illustrates how Trump’s reputation for shady associations (discussed by regulators at home and abroad) impeded at least one international deal. Aside from Australia, Trump floated ideas like building casinos in China or resorts in Europe during this era, but none came to fruition in the 1980s. Still, by reaching out to Moscow, attracting Gulf money (via asset sales), and attempting projects overseas, Trump in 1986–89 began extending his financial ties beyond U.S. borders – a trend that would grow in the 1990s as he sought capital from worldwide sources to rescue or expand his businesses.

## 4. Legal and Regulatory Scrutiny  
Trump’s aggressive business maneuvers in the late ’80s attracted legal disputes and regulatory scrutiny on multiple fronts:

- **Antitrust/Disclosure Violations:** Trump’s tactic of stealthily buying stock in target companies led to a run-in with federal law. In 1986–87 he secretly accumulated large positions in **Bally Manufacturing** and **Holiday Corp.** through Bear Stearns, likely hoping to avoid tipping off markets and triggering regulatory filing requirements. The FTC investigated and concluded Trump **violated the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act** (which mandates advance notice of large share acquisitions). In April 1988, the government filed a complaint detailing how Trump, via Bear Stearns, surpassed the HSR thresholds in both Holiday and Bally stock without timely disclosure ([News Release](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cases/1988/04/880405trumppressrelease.pdf#:~:text=HE%20VIOLATED%20PREMERGER%20NOTIFICATION%20REQillREMENTS,requirements%20when%20he%20acquired%20stock)) ([News Release](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cases/1988/04/880405trumppressrelease.pdf#:~:text=The%20complaint%20charges%20that%2C%20in,based%20in%20New%20York%20City)). Trump settled the charges, **paying a $750,000 civil penalty** while not admitting wrongdoing ([News Release](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cases/1988/04/880405trumppressrelease.pdf#:~:text=HE%20VIOLATED%20PREMERGER%20NOTIFICATION%20REQillREMENTS,requirements%20when%20he%20acquired%20stock)) ([News Release](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cases/1988/04/880405trumppressrelease.pdf#:~:text=The%20complaint%20charges%20that%2C%20in,based%20in%20New%20York%20City)). An FTC official noted this was at least the third case of a client using an investment bank to subvert reporting rules ([News Release](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cases/1988/04/880405trumppressrelease.pdf#:~:text=the%20District%20of%20Columbia,purchase%20voting%20securities%20of%20a)). This penalty was significant – it signaled that Trump’s Wall Street forays were being watched by regulators, and it put him on notice to follow merger disclosure laws going forward.

- **“Greenmail” Allegations:** Relatedly, Trump’s quick-profits stock deals prompted backlash from other investors. When Trump agreed to sell his Bally Manufacturing shares back to Bally’s management for a hefty profit in 1987, **shareholders sued**, accusing Bally of paying Trump **greenmail** (a premium to stave off his takeover threat) ([Trump Organization: Corporate Rap Sheet | Corporate Research Project](https://www.corp-research.org/trump-organization#:~:text=In%20the%20late%201980s%20Trump,federal%20judge%20sanctioned%20the%20deal)). The lawsuit claimed this enriched Trump at other shareholders’ expense. Trump and Bally denied any wrongdoing, and a federal judge refused to block the buyout, effectively allowing Trump’s lucrative exit ([Trump Organization: Corporate Rap Sheet | Corporate Research Project](https://www.corp-research.org/trump-organization#:~:text=In%20the%20late%201980s%20Trump,federal%20judge%20sanctioned%20the%20deal)). Nonetheless, the episode contributed to Trump’s image as a corporate raider willing to play hardball – and occasionally brush against the spirit (if not letter) of securities laws for personal gain.

- **Casino Regulatory Oversight:** In Atlantic City, Trump’s casino operations were under constant watch by New Jersey authorities. Gaining a casino license required extensive background checks. **NJ Division of Gaming Enforcement** investigators probed Trump’s history and associations. Notably, a 1979 FBI bribery investigation (in which Trump was interviewed but not charged) was scrutinized in light of NJ’s strict licensing laws ([The Rise and Fall of Donald Trump's Atlantic City Empire](https://www.phillymag.com/city/2015/08/16/donald-trump-atlantic-city-empire/#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%20probably%C2%A0shouldn%E2%80%99t%20even%20have,Trump%20Plaza%C2%A0was%20the)). Ultimately, the state approved Trump (his first casino license hearing in 1982 was perfunctory, lasting only 7 minutes ([The Rise and Fall of Donald Trump's Atlantic City Empire](https://www.phillymag.com/city/2015/08/16/donald-trump-atlantic-city-empire/#:~:text=investigation%2C%20after%20the%20release%20of,investigated%20for%20two%20hours%20earlier))), but as Trump’s casino holdings grew, regulators grew warier. During the 1988 license hearings for the Taj Mahal acquisition, some commissioners expressed open **doubts about Trump’s honesty and financial strategy**. They suspected Trump had manipulated stock prices during the Resorts International takeover fight and questioned the Taj’s funding plan. One Casino Control Commission member commented that Trump’s testimony was full of exaggerations and contradictions ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=lowball%20bid%20of%20%2415%20a,out%20scheme%20by)). The commission was also concerned that the **Taj was being financed almost entirely with junk bonds (debt) rather than owner equity**, which was unusual and risky for a casino. Despite reservations, regulators *approved* Trump’s Taj Mahal project – but it was a split decision that foreshadowed future trouble. Indeed, within a year of the Taj’s 1990 opening, the DGE filed reports critical of the casino’s finances and compliance lapses (see “Red Flags” below). New Jersey later imposed fines for certain violations at Trump’s casinos (e.g. a $200,000 fine in 1991 for improper conduct at Trump Plaza regarding a high-roller’s racist request ([Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 145 (Monday, September ...](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CREC-2016-09-26/html/CREC-2016-09-26-pt1-PgS6073-2.htm#:~:text=Congressional%20Record%2C%20Volume%20162%20Issue,the%201990s%2C%20John%20O%27Donnell)) ([Trump Plaza fined $200,000 for discrimination - UPI Archives](https://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/06/06/Trump-Plaza-fined-200000-for-discrimination/2869676180800/#:~:text=Trump%20Plaza%20fined%20%24200%2C000%20for,by%20transferring%20black%20and))). The intense oversight by NJ regulators during 1986–89 shows that as Trump’s gaming empire expanded, so did official concerns about everything from his financing sources to his operational integrity.

- **Lawsuits and Disputes:** Trump’s combative business style led to numerous legal disputes in this era. He was frequently in court either as plaintiff or defendant. For example, Trump sued the **City of New York** in the late ’80s over tax abatements and zoning issues for his West Side project. He fought a very public battle with tenants at 100 Central Park South: Trump had bought their apartment building intending to demolish it for a new development, and tenants accused him of harassment and sued to block evictions (the matter dragged on for years). In Atlantic City, Trump’s use of **eminent domain** to acquire neighboring properties led to ill will and legal pushback (one homeowner, Vera Coking, famously refused to sell to Trump and ultimately prevailed in court in the 1990s) ([Trump Organization: Corporate Rap Sheet | Corporate Research Project](https://www.corp-research.org/trump-organization#:~:text=One%20of%20those%2C%20Trump%20Plaza%2C,Doonesbury%20cartoons%20needling%20Donald%20Trump)) ([Trump Organization: Corporate Rap Sheet | Corporate Research Project](https://www.corp-research.org/trump-organization#:~:text=homeowner%20in%20Atlantic%20City%20who,Doonesbury%20cartoons%20needling%20Donald%20Trump)). While the Coking case’s climax was after 1989, it originated from Trump’s 1980s expansion attempts. Trump was also entangled in a major **contractors’ lawsuit**: many contractors who built the Taj Mahal later claimed Trump failed to pay them in full when the project ran into cost overruns, leading to litigation and liens on the property by 1990.  

- **International Scrutiny:** As noted, foreign regulators also eyed Trump warily. The most striking example is the **Australian NSW Police Board report** in 1987, which explicitly cited Trump’s “mafia connections” as a reason to reject his casino bid ([‘Mafia connections’ halted Trump’s 1987 casino plan - Taipei Times](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2017/09/08/2003678048#:~:text=At%20the%20time%2C%20Trump%20operated,close%20to%20owning%20a%20third)) ([‘Mafia connections’ halted Trump’s 1987 casino plan - Taipei Times](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2017/09/08/2003678048#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAtlantic%20City%20would%20be%20a,report%20dated%20April%203%2C%201987)). That confidential report (made public 30 years later) shows that Trump’s reputation for associating with unsavory characters (such as mob-linked Teamsters or contractors in New York and New Jersey) had gained international notice. While Trump was never charged with any mafia-related crime, investigators in multiple jurisdictions took note of his links to figures like Roy Cohn’s clients and organized crime-tied construction firms. This cloud of suspicion meant extra scrutiny for Trump’s deals: even **Switzerland** briefly detained Trump’s yacht in 1988 at the request of creditors of Khashoggi (the previous owner), illustrating how his flashy purchases could entangle him in others’ legal troubles ([Khashoggi's Fall | Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/1989/09/dunne198909?srsltid=AfmBOor66ygv3v3kHMB6-aWeZovjp8Fy3mR0H2qaAmD5q0qAfv2c0tsb#:~:text=Now%2C%20reportedly%20broke%2C%20or%20broke,efforts%20to%20avoid%20extradition%20when)) ([Khashoggi's Fall | Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/1989/09/dunne198909?srsltid=AfmBOor66ygv3v3kHMB6-aWeZovjp8Fy3mR0H2qaAmD5q0qAfv2c0tsb#:~:text=and%20mail%20fraud%2C%20not%20for,was%20present%20to%20witness%20his)). 

In summary, between 1986 and 1989 Trump faced a number of **legal challenges** – from federal penalties over stock deals, to lawsuits accusing him of unethical tactics, to regulatory reviews of his casino licensing and financing. Although he often managed to settle or skirt major consequences during that time (e.g. paying fines rather than admitting fault), the scrutiny highlighted the **high-risk, high-conflict nature** of Trump’s business methods. As one outcome, Trump became more familiar with bankruptcy courts and workouts by 1990, when the fallout from his late-’80s deals hit in full force.

## 5. Financial Red Flags and Unusual Maneuvers  
Trump’s aggressive growth in the late ’80s was accompanied by numerous **warning signs** that his finances were overextended or opaque. Key red flags included:

- **Excessive Leverage:** Virtually all of Trump’s major acquisitions in 1986–89 were done with *minimal cash down* and **maximum debt**. His willingness to take on **huge loans** and **high interest rates** alarmed analysts even before markets turned. For example, Trump financed the Taj Mahal almost entirely with debt – notably a **$675 million junk-bond issue at 14% interest** ([Trump casino empire dogged by bad bets in Atlantic City](https://www.newscentermaine.com/article/news/nation-now/trump-casino-empire-dogged-by-bad-bets-in-atlantic-city/97-264767870#:~:text=City%20www,The)), an extraordinarily expensive loan by industry standards (typical bank loans at the time were under 10%). This meant the Taj needed *enormous* cash flow just to pay its interest (over $90 million per year in interest alone). Similarly, Trump’s Plaza Hotel purchase was 98% debt-financed, and his new airline was bought with hundreds of millions in bank loans. By 1989, the Trump Organization reportedly owed **billions** to more than 70 banks ([Banking on the Donald. | American Banker](https://www.americanbanker.com/news/banking-on-the-donald#:~:text=Each%20of%20the%20banks%20with,public%20stature%20to%20generate%20wealth)) ([Banking on the Donald. | American Banker](https://www.americanbanker.com/news/banking-on-the-donald#:~:text=Chemical%20Bank%2C%20for%20example%2C%20now,Trump%20organization%20operates%20the%20property)). This highly leveraged capital structure left Trump with **no cushion if revenues faltered** or if the economy turned – which is exactly what happened after the 1987 stock market crash and late-’89 recession. In effect, Trump was betting that asset values would keep rising and that his properties would earn enough to cover gargantuan debt payments, a gamble that observers likened to “flying too close to the sun” ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=If%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20current%20campaign%20is,of%20success%E2%80%94nearly%20did%20him%20in)) ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=,Greek%20mythology%E2%80%99s%20Icarus%20and%20Narcissus)). One casino analyst, Marvin Roffman, bluntly told Trump in 1988 that the Taj Mahal deal was a mistake given the debt load ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=%E2%80%9CHe%20called%20me%20on%20the,%E2%80%99%E2%80%9D)) – an assessment proven correct when the Taj couldn’t meet its interest obligations. Excessive leverage was the most prominent red flag in Trump’s late-’80s empire.  

- **Unconventional Financing Practices:** In pursuit of deals, Trump often stretched normal financing practices to the limit. One red flag was his use of **Bear Stearns as a surrogate buyer** to secretly accumulate stock positions (as noted in Section 4). This creative tactic helped Trump attempt “surprise” takeover plays, but it violated disclosure laws and suggested a willingness to **skirt rules** for gain ([News Release](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cases/1988/04/880405trumppressrelease.pdf#:~:text=the%20District%20of%20Columbia,purchase%20voting%20securities%20of%20a)) ([News Release](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cases/1988/04/880405trumppressrelease.pdf#:~:text=The%20complaint%20charges%20that%2C%20in,based%20in%20New%20York%20City)). Another example was Trump’s reliance on **payment-in-kind bonds** and other risky financial instruments. For the Trump Castle casino, he issued high-interest securities that deferred interest payments – a sign that even at inception the property couldn’t generate enough cash to service standard debt. Additionally, Trump sometimes **personally guaranteed loans** or put up collateral far in excess of prudent levels (by 1990, he had pledged virtually all his assets to secure loans ([Banking on the Donald. | American Banker](https://www.americanbanker.com/news/banking-on-the-donald#:~:text=Each%20of%20the%20banks%20with,public%20stature%20to%20generate%20wealth)) ([Banking on the Donald. | American Banker](https://www.americanbanker.com/news/banking-on-the-donald#:~:text=Chase%20Manhattan%20Bank%2C%20which%20originally,Street%20in%20New%20York%20City))). Such moves gave him access to quick capital but at the expense of safety. New Jersey regulators flagged that Trump was not putting enough equity into the Taj Mahal – violating the norm that casino owners have significant personal stake – but they granted him a rare exemption to proceed with an almost fully debt-financed project ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=lowball%20bid%20of%20%2415%20a,out%20scheme%20by)). This waiver itself was a warning sign: the state was essentially betting that Trump could beat the odds with a heavily leveraged casino, something unprecedented.

- **Cash Flow Strains:** Even before the decade ended, evidence mounted that Trump’s properties were **not generating enough cash** to support his debt. Forbes magazine reported that the Plaza Hotel lost money in 1989–90, and Trump Shuttle was operating at a loss due to high costs. By late 1989, Trump began quietly tapping **additional loans** to cover interest payments – a classic red flag of a Ponzi-like situation where debt service requires more debt. Indeed, in **November 1990 Trump missed an interest payment** on the Taj Mahal bonds (technically defaulting) (['Little guy' contractors still angry at Trump Taj bankruptcy | AP News](https://apnews.com/article/10bbe40a86774bac9ad1fbd3a936c808#:~:text=News%20apnews,to%20his%20junk%20bond)), but even earlier, in 1989, analysts saw trouble coming. Trump’s own financiers started to worry: one banking consortium required him to maintain a cash reserve, which he struggled to do. The **debt service coverage ratios** on his acquisitions were abnormally low. For instance, the Plaza’s $16 million annual cash flow was far below what was needed to service $380 million in loans (interest alone was around $30 million/year) ([Forbes: Plaza lost $100 million in 2 years - UPI Archives](https://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/06/23/Forbes-Plaza-lost-100-million-in-2-years/2698677649600/#:~:text=Forbes%3A%20Plaza%20lost%20%24100%20million,If%20the%20banks%20foreclosed)). Such mismatches pointed to an impending liquidity crunch. In Atlantic City, gaming regulators and Wall Street analysts like Roffman publicly warned that the Taj Mahal’s projected earnings couldn’t cover its $3 million *per week* interest burden ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=%E2%80%9CHe%20called%20me%20on%20the,%E2%80%99%E2%80%9D)). Trump’s response was often to dismiss these concerns – but the numbers painted a dire picture of **over-leverage and under-performance**.

- **Signs of Money Laundering and Compliance Lapses:** Another red flag area was the **lax financial controls** in some of Trump’s businesses, especially casinos. Casinos are cash-intensive and can be targets for money laundering. In the case of Trump’s properties, regulators later documented serious anti-money-laundering (AML) failures almost from the start. **Trump’s Taj Mahal casino failed to file required reports of large cash transactions at least 106 times in its first 18 months of operation** ([Money Laundering and the Trump Taj Mahal | Trump, Inc. | WNYC Studios](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/trumpinc/episodes/money-laundering-trump-taj-mahal#:~:text=PAGLIERY%3A%20And%20in%20this%20settlement,like%2C%20one%20a%20week%2C%20right)). (While this specific finding was formally revealed in the early 1990s, it reflects practices set in the late ’80s during preparation for the Taj’s opening.) The failure to log transactions above $10,000 – as required by the Bank Secrecy Act – meant that suspicious movements of money could go unreported ([Money Laundering and the Trump Taj Mahal | Trump, Inc. | WNYC Studios](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/trumpinc/episodes/money-laundering-trump-taj-mahal#:~:text=followed%20the%20anti,like%2C%20one%20a%20week%2C%20right)) ([Money Laundering and the Trump Taj Mahal | Trump, Inc. | WNYC Studios](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/trumpinc/episodes/money-laundering-trump-taj-mahal#:~:text=MARRITZ%3A%20The%20specific%20rule%20he%27s,law%20enforcement%20track%20possible%20crimes)). In fact, in 1998 the Taj Mahal was fined $477,000 by FinCEN for willful AML violations dating back to its early years, the largest casino fine of its kind at the time ([Money Laundering and the Trump Taj Mahal - WNYC Studios](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/trumpinc/episodes/money-laundering-trump-taj-mahal#:~:text=Money%20Laundering%20and%20the%20Trump,for%20this%20type%20of)). New Jersey’s gaming enforcement also cited Trump’s casinos for inadequate internal financial controls. It was noted that during 1990–91, the Taj was a preferred gambling spot for certain **Russian mob figures**, including a top Russian mob boss who was found to have been living at Trump Tower and gambling at the Taj ([Money Laundering and the Trump Taj Mahal | Trump, Inc. | WNYC Studios](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/trumpinc/episodes/money-laundering-trump-taj-mahal#:~:text=MARRITZ%3A%20This%20is%20what%20the,he%20spent%20reporting%20this%20story)) ([Money Laundering and the Trump Taj Mahal | Trump, Inc. | WNYC Studios](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/trumpinc/episodes/money-laundering-trump-taj-mahal#:~:text=PAGLIERY%3A%20The%20guy%20that%20they,Russian%20mobster%20in%20the%20world)). The coincidence of lax AML oversight and the presence of organized crime money at Trump properties raised eyebrows. While Trump wasn’t accused of personally facilitating laundering, the **pattern of regulatory violations** and the clientele his businesses attracted signaled *risk factors* consistent with money laundering vulnerabilities. This would garner more attention in the 2010s, but the roots lay in the compliance shortcomings of the late ’80s.  

- **Stock Speculation and Quick Flips:** Trump’s habit of dabbling in other companies’ stocks (outside his core business) can be seen as a red flag too – it suggested a short-term, speculative approach to wealth. Instead of focusing on generating operating profits, Trump at times acted like a speculator: e.g. buying **Bally stock and selling it back for a ~$31 million profit within weeks** ([Trump Organization: Corporate Rap Sheet | Corporate Research Project](https://www.corp-research.org/trump-organization#:~:text=In%20the%20late%201980s%20Trump,federal%20judge%20sanctioned%20the%20deal)), or taking a stake in **Hilton Hotels** and then selling on rumors. This was perfectly legal (aside from the disclosure timing issue), but it indicated that Trump’s finances had an unusually high reliance on one-off windfalls rather than steady earnings. In 1987, Trump even bragged that he made ~$100 million by “predicting” the stock market crash and selling most of his stock holdings beforehand ([Trump Sold Stocks Before Black Monday Crash in 1987 - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-sold-stocks-before-black-monday-crash-1987-2017-10#:~:text=,Trump%20said)) ([Trump Sold Stocks Before Black Monday Crash in 1987 - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-sold-stocks-before-black-monday-crash-1987-2017-10#:~:text=Luckily%2C%20now,the%20downfall%20of%20the%20market)). Such claims, if true, underscore that a chunk of Trump’s late-80s liquidity came from asset trades, not from the underlying profitability of his buildings or casinos. The reliance on asset appreciation and sales to service debt is a classic red flag in finance – it works only as long as asset prices keep rising.

In summary, **Trump’s financial approach in 1986–89 was exceptionally high-risk**. He maximized leverage, employed unusual financing schemes, and paid little heed to debt ratios or compliance niceties. The booming ’80s masked these red flags for a while, as asset values climbed and credit was easy. But by the end of 1989, cracks were showing: Trump’s empire was over-leveraged, several projects were underperforming, and regulators had taken note of governance lapses. The stage was set for a financial reckoning (indeed, in 1990–91 Trump’s businesses underwent massive debt restructurings and multiple bankruptcies ([Trump Organization: Corporate Rap Sheet | Corporate Research Project](https://www.corp-research.org/trump-organization#:~:text=Trump%2C%20who%20was%20bumped%20from,in%20the%20Grand%20Hyatt%20in))). With hindsight, the late ’80s red flags clearly foreshadowed that Trump was headed for a crash unless he dramatically deleveraged – a step he resisted until crisis forced his hand.

## 6. Public vs. Insider Accounts of Trump’s Finances  
Throughout 1986–1989, Donald Trump carefully cultivated a public image as an extraordinarily successful, cash-rich mogul – **“the Donald”** who always won at the money game. However, internal records and insider testimonies often contradicted his public statements. There was a stark **discrepancy between Trump’s self-promoting pronouncements and the behind-the-scenes reality**:

- **Inflated Wealth Claims:** Publicly, Trump boasted about his wealth and deal-making genius. He convinced publications like *Forbes* to estimate his net worth in the **billions** (Forbes listed him at $1.0–$3.0 billion in the late ’80s) based largely on his own provided figures. In a 1987 profile, Trump famously bragged, “I’ve got very little debt” and implied his business was throwing off huge cash – statements at odds with his highly leveraged balance sheet. By contrast, *insider accounts* and later evaluations showed Trump’s **true financial condition was far more precarious**. In 1990, as his loans came due, Trump’s accountants privately admitted that without asset sales or new financing, he **lacked liquidity to meet obligations**, and Forbes actually *removed* Trump from its 400 Richest list when it became clear his net worth had possibly dropped to zero or below after debt ([Trump Organization: Corporate Rap Sheet | Corporate Research Project](https://www.corp-research.org/trump-organization#:~:text=Trump%2C%20who%20was%20bumped%20from,in%20the%20Grand%20Hyatt%20in)). Court documents from banking negotiations in 1990 revealed that Trump had **personally guaranteed $830 million** of debt and was down to just a few million in available cash – a far cry from the untold riches he projected. Thus, the public image of Trump as a billionaire in 1986–89 was arguably a mirage based on asset valuations that didn’t reflect crushing liabilities.

- **Art of the Deal vs. Reality:** Trump’s 1987 bestselling book *“The Art of the Deal”* further cemented his public legend. In it, Trump portrayed himself as a shrewd yet cautious deal-maker – someone who **“believes in spending what you have to, but not spending more than you should”**, and who never lets “personal preferences affect business judgment” ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDeals%20are%20my%20art%20form%2C%E2%80%9D,%E2%80%9D)). However, almost immediately after, Trump’s actual behavior diverged from this credo. As noted, he bought the Plaza Hotel largely *because he personally loved it*, admitting “I haven’t purchased a building like this since I was a little boy – it was a dream,” even though the business fundamentals were poor ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=That%20spring%2C%20though%2C%20he%20purchased,debt%20to%20which%20Trump%20committed)). He likewise paid top dollar for his airline for prestige reasons. These actions – essentially *overpaying out of ego or emotion* – contradicted the disciplined investor image he promoted. Tony Schwartz, Trump’s ghostwriter for *Art of the Deal*, later revealed that Trump **routinely exaggerated or lied about financial details** during the book’s creation. “Trump lied about how much money he spent or earned on his projects. *He lied strategically. He had a complete lack of conscience about it,*” Schwartz said ([‘Art Of The Deal’ Ghostwriter Regrets Trump Book: ‘I Put Lipstick On A Pig’ - TPM – Talking Points Memo](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/tony-schwartz-trump-art-deal#:~:text=According%20to%20Schwartz%2C%20Trump%20lied,on%20his%20real%20estate%20projects)). For example, if a building cost $100 million, Trump might insist they print $150 million; if he sold an apartment for $5 million, he’d suggest saying $6 million – all to puff up his successes. These insider revelations indicate that the Trump of the book (and media interviews) was a crafted persona, often **out of step with the underlying numbers**.

- **Boasting Amid Financial Strain:** Even as cracks appeared in 1989, Trump maintained a brave public face. He dismissed reports of financial trouble as media exaggeration. In March 1990 – on the eve of his financial collapse – Trump told a reporter, *“I have a tremendous amount of cash.”* (['Little guy' contractors still angry at Trump Taj bankruptcy | AP News](https://apnews.com/article/10bbe40a86774bac9ad1fbd3a936c808#:~:text=News%20apnews,to%20his%20junk%20bond)) This statement was **directly refuted by insider information**: at that point Trump was struggling to make payments, and his executives knew the company was running out of cash. Similarly, Trump publicly projected confidence about the Taj Mahal’s prospects (“It’s the eighth wonder of the world, it will be a big success”), while internally, his CFO and casino managers were raising alarms about insufficient revenues. When analyst Marvin Roffman predicted the Taj would bankrupt Trump, Trump publicly attacked Roffman and pressured his employer to fire him ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=%E2%80%9CHe%20called%20me%20on%20the,%E2%80%99%E2%80%9D)). Trump insisted everything was fine – only to put the Taj into bankruptcy **within one year**, vindicating Roffman’s insider perspective. This pattern – **Trump denying problems publicly while insiders saw a crisis –** was a hallmark of the era. Bankers who negotiated with Trump in 1990 noted that his personal lifestyle and public relations spin hadn’t adjusted to the new reality that he was essentially broke and “working for the banks” to repay debt ([Banking on the Donald. | American Banker](https://www.americanbanker.com/news/banking-on-the-donald#:~:text=Says%20one%20banker%20close%20to,employee%20in%20the%20casino%20business)) ([Banking on the Donald. | American Banker](https://www.americanbanker.com/news/banking-on-the-donald#:~:text=Each%20of%20the%20banks%20with,public%20stature%20to%20generate%20wealth)). 

- **Hyperbole and Media Spin:** Trump was a master of using the media to inflate his successes. He often announced deals with grandiose language. For instance, when he acquired the Taj Mahal, he bragged about outsmarting Merv Griffin and pulling off a fantastic deal – yet **commissioners who heard Trump’s sworn testimony noted it was riddled with “hyperbole”** and contradictions ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=lowball%20bid%20of%20%2415%20a,out%20scheme%20by)). In press releases, Trump would claim record profits or values for his properties that were not borne out by later audits. An example: Trump claimed in 1988 that Trump Tower’s retail and office space was *“the most valuable in New York”* and that his net worth “dwarfed” previous estimates, none of which could be confirmed. Meanwhile, **internal documents** (like those submitted to gaming regulators) painted a more modest picture. In one casino license filing, Trump’s accountants listed numerous contingent liabilities and debt guarantees that Trump never mentioned publicly. 

- **Insider Commentary:** Many within Trump’s organization or who dealt closely with him had a far less rosy view than Trump’s public narrative. **Barbara Res**, who had been loyal to Trump, later commented that by 1988 *“he was just buying up things with loans…nothing satisfied him”* ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=%E2%80%9CHe%20was%20just%20buying%20up,%E2%80%9D)) – implying a reckless expansion. Trump’s top casino executive, **Jack O’Donnell**, resigned in 1990 and wrote that Trump’s operations were poorly managed and that Trump often ignored bad news, preferring a “yes-man” environment. These insiders describe a Trump whose actual business practices (delaying payables, renegotiating debt, cutting corners on quality) belied the image of a flawlessly successful tycoon. Additionally, Trump’s own father, Fred, was reportedly concerned by the late ’80s that Donald was overextended; at one point in 1989–90 Fred Trump intervened by secretly purchasing millions in casino chips to prop up Donald’s failing Trump Castle casino – an emergency measure illustrating how dire the internal situation was, even as Donald continued to project confidence externally.

**Conclusion:** During 1986–1989, Donald Trump orchestrated a series of audacious business moves that made him an icon of the extravagant ’80s. He amassed casinos, landmark buildings, an airline, and more – often partnering with famous names and big banks. However, these years also revealed consistent patterns in Trump’s financial dealings: reliance on other people’s money (OPM) via extreme leverage, bold risk-taking (and rule-bending) in pursuit of growth, and a penchant for publicity and self-promotion that sometimes overtook economic reality. Key figures from Merv Griffin to Citibank played roles in Trump’s ascent, even as regulators from the FTC to New Jersey raised cautionary flags. Internationally, Trump dipped his toes in foreign waters – Soviet hotel talks, Middle Eastern yacht deals, Australian casino bids – reflecting an opportunistic outreach beyond the U.S., though not yet the deep foreign financing that would characterize some of his later ventures. For all of Trump’s public bravado about his Midas touch, the late 1980s produced *insider accounts of an empire under strain*: legal penalties, mounting debts, and business partners questioning Trump’s tactics. By comparing Trump’s public statements with insider evidence, a picture emerges of a **highly leveraged empire kept afloat by optimism and bravado**, and of a businessman whose *claims* of unbounded success often masked the fragile, debt-laden reality of his enterprises ([‘Art Of The Deal’ Ghostwriter Regrets Trump Book: ‘I Put Lipstick On A Pig’ - TPM – Talking Points Memo](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/tony-schwartz-trump-art-deal#:~:text=According%20to%20Schwartz%2C%20Trump%20lied,on%20his%20real%20estate%20projects)) (['Little guy' contractors still angry at Trump Taj bankruptcy | AP News](https://apnews.com/article/10bbe40a86774bac9ad1fbd3a936c808#:~:text=News%20apnews,to%20his%20junk%20bond)). The discrepancies, risks, and patterns evident in 1986–1989 not only foreshadowed Trump’s near-collapse in 1990–92, but also provided a blueprint of the aggressive and controversial financial style that would continue to define his career.
