# Donald Trump’s Financial Dealings (2018–2021): A Comprehensive Analysis

Former President **Donald Trump’s finances from 2018 through 2021** reveal a complex picture of real estate operations, debt pressures, revenue streams, and legal scrutiny – all intensified by his tenure in the White House. This period spans the latter part of Trump’s business career during his presidency (2017–Jan 2021) and the transition back to private life in 2021 ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=President%20Donald%20Trump%20paid%20just,in%20the%20New%20York%20Times)) ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=During%20his%20first%20two%20years,income%20taxes)).

## Real Estate & Business Transactions (2018–2021)

Trump’s business empire centers on **real estate holdings** – hotels, golf resorts, office buildings, and licensing agreements. During 2018–2021, the Trump Organization **undertook few new acquisitions**, largely adhering to a self-imposed moratorium on new foreign deals while Trump was president ([Donald Trump Jr. visits India to help sell apartments | MPR News](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/02/20/donald-trump-jr-visits-india-to-help-sell-apartments#:~:text=The%20newspaper%20ads%20promise%20that,a%20day%20later)). Instead, the focus was on managing or restructuring existing properties, and selectively divesting assets for liquidity. Key developments included: 

- **Asset Sales:** In 2019, the Trump Organization **sold a Beverly Hills estate** (one of Trump’s last West Coast holdings) for $13.5 million, nearly doubling the 2007 purchase price ([President Trump sells Beverly Hills home for nearly twice what he paid for it - L.A. Business First](https://www.bizjournals.com/losangeles/news/2019/06/13/trump-sells-beverly-hills-home.html#:~:text=The%20Trump%20Organization%20has%20sold,for%20%247%20million%20in%202007)) ([President Trump sells Beverly Hills home for nearly twice what he paid for it - L.A.

Notably, the buyer was a company linked to Indonesian tycoon Hary Tanoesoedibjo – a business partner in Trump’s Indonesia projects ([President Trump sells Beverly Hills home for nearly twice what he paid for it - L.A. Business First](https://www.bizjournals.com/losangeles/news/2019/06/13/trump-sells-beverly-hills-home.html#:~:text=The%20buyer%20of%20the%20property,based%20Allied%20Properties%20Ltd)). This off-market sale highlighted Trump’s reliance on friendly foreign partners for liquidity. Trump also attempted to sell the lease of the Trump International Hotel in Washington D.C. (located in the federally owned Old Post Office building) – initially seeking $500 million in 2019 – though a sale did not close until 2022 ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=Trump%20is%20now%20making%20a,than%20%2473%20million%20since%202016)). 

- **No Major Acquisitions:** True to pledges, the Trump Organization **did not acquire significant new properties** internationally during Trump’s presidency ([Donald Trump Jr. visits India to help sell apartments | MPR News](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/02/20/donald-trump-jr-visits-india-to-help-sell-apartments#:~:text=The%20newspaper%20ads%20promise%20that,a%20day%20later)). Domestic expansion plans (such as a proposed new hotel chain under brands like “Scion” or “American Idea”) were put on hold amid political scrutiny and lack of market appetite ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=Experts%20say%20the%20prospect%20of,Trump%20name%20on%20their%20properties)) ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=Experts%20say%20the%20prospect%20of,Trump%20name%20on%20their%20properties)). One high-profile project, Trump SoHo in New York, had its Trump branding removed and was rebranded as “The Dominick” in 2017 due to poor performance and reputational issues ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=In%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20home%20base%20of,of%20the%20golf%20course%20lease)). Similarly, the Trump Organization **lost management contracts** for some overseas ventures: for example, Trump’s team was **ousted from the Trump Ocean Club hotel in Panama** in 2018 after a legal feud, with workers physically prying Trump’s name off the building ([Panama court evicts Trump management from hotel in bitter spat | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/panama-court-evicts-trump-management-from-hotel-in-bitter-spat-idUSKBN1GH2XM/#:~:text=PANAMA%20CITY%20%28Reuters%29%20,regain%20control%20of%20the%20property)) ([Panama court evicts Trump management from hotel in bitter spat | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/panama-court-evicts-trump-management-from-hotel-in-bitter-spat-idUSKBN1GH2XM/#:~:text=The%20bitter%20dispute%20surrounding%20the,president%20took%20office%20last%20year)). Several other internationally licensed projects (Toronto, Vancouver) also terminated the Trump branding during this period, reflecting the **brand’s polarizing impact** on business.

- **Property Developments & Projects:** Projects inked before 2017 continued abroad. In **India**, where the Trump brand extended to luxury residential towers in cities like Mumbai, Pune, and Gurgaon, Trump’s sons pushed sales during 2018. Full-page ads even offered buyers a “dinner with Donald Trump Jr.” – a promotion ethics experts criticized as blurring business with political influence ([Donald Trump Jr. visits India to help sell apartments | MPR News](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/02/20/donald-trump-jr-visits-india-to-help-sell-apartments#:~:text=The%20ads%2C%20which%20have%20run,development%20outside%20the%20Indian%20capital)) ([Donald Trump Jr. visits India to help sell apartments | MPR News](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/02/20/donald-trump-jr-visits-india-to-help-sell-apartments#:~:text=The%20newspaper%20ads%20promise%20that,a%20day%20later)). In **Indonesia**, construction moved forward on two Trump-branded resort projects (in Bali and outside Jakarta) in partnership with MNC Group – deals signed pre-presidency but watched closely due to later involvement of Chinese state companies in the project’s financing ([Trump ZTE Order Comes After China Gave Millions to Trump Organization-Tied Project - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-zte-order-after-china-gave-millions-to-trump-organization-tied-project-2018-5#:~:text=)) ([Trump ZTE Order Comes After China Gave Millions to Trump Organization-Tied Project - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-zte-order-after-china-gave-millions-to-trump-organization-tied-project-2018-5#:~:text=the%20developer%20of%20that%20project,hotels%20and%20a%20golf%20course)). No new Trump real estate ventures were launched during his presidency, and after leaving office in 2021, the Trump Organization explored re-entering markets (for instance, discussing new hotel branding opportunities in GOP-friendly locales), but faced challenges due to the brand’s divisiveness ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=Experts%20say%20the%20prospect%20of,Trump%20name%20on%20their%20properties)) ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=The%20Girl%20Scouts%20did%20not,for%20leaving%20the%20Trump%20building)).

**Financial Performance of Major Properties:** Trump’s core properties experienced **mixed financial performance** from 2018 to 2021, with many seeing revenue declines – exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 – and some requiring cash infusions. Notable examples include:

- **Trump National Doral (Miami):** This golf resort, once Trump’s top revenue-generator, **saw steep declines** in the late 2010s. Revenue fell from about $92 million in 2015 to $75 million in 2017, and net operating income plunged by 69% in that period ([Trump Doral | Trump Organization Finances](https://therealdeal.com/miami/2019/05/15/trump-dorals-financial-results-falter-due-to-trump-name-report/#:~:text=Overall%2C%20from%202015%20to%202017%2C,million%20during%20that%20same%20timeframe)). Executives even argued for tax relief by admitting the **“Trump” name had become a business liability** post-2016, driving away some clientele ([Trump Doral | Trump Organization Finances](https://therealdeal.com/miami/2019/05/15/trump-dorals-financial-results-falter-due-to-trump-name-report/#:~:text=But%20the%20resort%E2%80%99s%20finances%20paint,percent%20from%202015%20to%202017)) ([Trump Doral | Trump Organization Finances](https://therealdeal.com/miami/2019/05/15/trump-dorals-financial-results-falter-due-to-trump-name-report/#:~:text=The%20property%20is%20%E2%80%9Cseverely%20underperforming%E2%80%9D,%E2%80%9D)). The downward trend continued – by 2020, Doral’s annual revenues were reported at only **$44 million** (per Trump’s disclosure) ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=Financial%20records%20show%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20real,according%20to%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20financial%20disclosures)) ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=events%20being%20canceled%20by%20organizations,to%20avoid%20associating%20with%20Trump)), reflecting both the pandemic’s hit to hospitality and persistent brand challenges. (Trump infamously floated hosting the 2020 G7 summit at Doral to boost its fortunes, but withdrew after bipartisan criticism of self-dealing.)

- **Trump International Hotel, Washington D.C.:** Opened in 2016, the D.C. hotel became a focal point of Trump’s presidency – and struggled financially behind the scenes. According to House Oversight findings, Trump’s D.C. hotel **lost over $70 million** during 2016–2020, even as Trump **reported over $150 million in revenues** from it on federal disclosures ([Trump Received 'Preferential Treatment' on Loan From Deutsche Bank: House Oversight - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-received-preferential-treatment-on-loan-from-deutsche-bank-house-oversight-2021-10#:~:text=Trump%20in%20financial%20disclosures%20reported,in%20income%20from%20the%20hotel)) ([Trump Received 'Preferential Treatment' on Loan From Deutsche Bank: House Oversight - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-received-preferential-treatment-on-loan-from-deutsche-bank-house-oversight-2021-10#:~:text=But%20the%20hotel%20lost%20over,to%20aid%20the%20struggling%20hotel)). The hotel relied on large capital injections (at least $24 million from other Trump businesses) to stay afloat ([Trump Received 'Preferential Treatment' on Loan From Deutsche Bank: House Oversight - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-received-preferential-treatment-on-loan-from-deutsche-bank-house-oversight-2021-10#:~:text=Trump%20in%20financial%20disclosures%20reported,in%20income%20from%20the%20hotel)). It also benefited from patronage by foreign governments, who spent at least **$3.7 million at the hotel** during Trump’s term ([Trump Received 'Preferential Treatment' on Loan From Deutsche Bank: House Oversight - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-received-preferential-treatment-on-loan-from-deutsche-bank-house-oversight-2021-10#:~:text=,the%20committee%20said)). These foreign payments raised conflict-of-interest alarms (see *Political & Business Overlaps*). By late 2021, Trump was seeking to sell the lease as losses mounted and his tenure ended ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=Trump%20is%20now%20making%20a,than%20%2473%20million%20since%202016)).

- **Golf Resorts in Scotland and Ireland:** Trump’s resorts in Turnberry (Scotland) and Doonbeg (Ireland) continued to **operate at a loss**. In 2020, amid pandemic shutdowns, Trump’s UK companies disclosed combined losses of around $5.7 million and **claimed £3.3 million (≈$4.5 million) in UK government furlough subsidies** to cover payroll ([Trump's Scottish Golf Courses Claimed $4 Million in UK COVID Aid - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-scotland-golf-courses-claimed-4-million-uk-covid-aid-2021-12#:~:text=Former%20President%20Donald%20Trump%27s%20Scottish,19%20pandemic)) ([Trump's Scottish Golf Courses Claimed $4 Million in UK COVID Aid - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-scotland-golf-courses-claimed-4-million-uk-covid-aid-2021-12#:~:text=Additional%20government%20data%20reviewed%20by,retention%20program%20persisted)).

While Trump handed day-to-day control to his sons in 2017, he retained financial interest, meaning these government payments – and a nearly £1 million UK tax break for tourism businesses – ultimately **benefited his family business** ([Scottish bailout puts Trump's golf resorts in line for £1m tax rebate](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/10/scottish-bailout-means-trumps-golf-resorts-in-line-for-1m-tax-rebate#:~:text=Scottish%20bailout%20puts%20Trump%27s%20golf,bailout%20for%20tourism%20businesses)).

- **Urban Properties (New York and Chicago):** Trump’s commercial real estate also felt headwinds. For instance, **Trump Tower and 40 Wall Street in Manhattan** faced higher vacancy and lower lease rates as many tenants sought to distance themselves from the Trump brand ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=according%20to%20reports%20from%20firms,Trump%E2%80%99s%20name%20is%20on%20it)) ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMost%20New%20York%20tenants%20want,%E2%80%9D)). At 40 Wall Street – a 72-story office tower – occupancy fell to 84% (below the ~89% local average in early 2021) and Trump had to charge rent discounts to attract tenants ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMost%20New%20York%20tenants%20want,%E2%80%9D)) ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=Occupancy%20was%2084,closer%20to%20%2450%2C%20he%20said)). By Q1 2021, **cash flow at 40 Wall St. was insufficient to fully cover its debt payments**, placing its $160 million loan on a servicer watchlist for potential default ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=The%20property%E2%80%99s%20financials%20have%20tumbled,risky%20territory%2C%20the%20reports%20say)). In Chicago, the Trump International Hotel & Tower saw sluggish condo sales and struggled to fill retail space ([Trump Doral | Trump Organization Finances](https://therealdeal.com/miami/2019/05/15/trump-dorals-financial-results-falter-due-to-trump-name-report/#:~:text=But%20company%20figures%20filed%20with,reported%20similar%20drops%20in%20revenue)), while its hotel portion, like others, suffered from the pandemic and Trump’s political baggage (the property was even used as collateral for loans). 

- **Mar-a-Lago and Other Clubs:** Not all properties suffered uniformly. **Mar-a-Lago**, Trump’s private club in Palm Beach, experienced a surge of interest during his presidency – membership initiation fees doubled to $200,000 after his election, and the club became an elite gathering spot for those seeking proximity to power. Annual revenues at Mar-a-Lago rose during his term (reportedly $21.4 million in 2019) but dipped in 2020 when the club was partially closed due to COVID-19 ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=Financial%20records%20show%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20real,according%20to%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20financial%20disclosures)). By 2021, Mar-a-Lago emerged as Trump’s post-presidential base of operations, and its fortunes were rebounding with Trump’s return and the resumption of galas and political events there. Likewise, some **golf clubs in the U.S.** saw loyal patronage from Trump’s supporters, although many corporate tournaments and charities had withdrawn events since 2017 to avoid controversy ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=his%20Doral%20golf%20resort%2C%20said,had%20damaged%20his%20business%20model)) ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20actually%20not%20about%20the,to%20avoid%20associating%20with%20Trump)).

In summary, **2018–2021 was a challenging period for Trump’s real estate portfolio**. The presidency brought unparalleled publicity and some new business opportunities, but also **dampened the performance of many Trump properties** due to reputational polarization, lost deals, and the pandemic shock. Trump’s company often needed to inject funds or lobby for tax relief to support struggling assets ([Trump Received 'Preferential Treatment' on Loan From Deutsche Bank: House Oversight - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-received-preferential-treatment-on-loan-from-deutsche-bank-house-oversight-2021-10#:~:text=Trump%20in%20financial%20disclosures%20reported,in%20income%20from%20the%20hotel)) ([Trump Doral | Trump Organization Finances](https://therealdeal.com/miami/2019/05/15/trump-dorals-financial-results-falter-due-to-trump-name-report/#:~:text=The%20Trump%20Organization%20dismissed%20the,and%202018%2C%20the%20Post%20said)). These difficulties set the stage for the debt strains and strategic pivots discussed next.

## Debt & Liquidity

Trump’s businesses are highly leveraged, and by the late 2010s a **wall of debt was coming due.** In 2020, The New York Times obtained Trump’s tax data and reported he was personally liable for **roughly $421 million in loans** coming due within the next few years ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=each%20in%202016%20and%202017)) ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=Trump%2C%20who%20has%20fiercely%20guarded,of%20the%20past%2015%20years)). Many of these debts entered their repayment or refinancing window during 2018–2021, raising **acute liquidity concerns** given the mixed performance of his properties. Here we detail Trump’s debt obligations and how he managed (or struggled with) them in this period:

- **Outstanding Loans:** Trump’s real estate empire carried several major loans maturing in 2021–2024. His biggest lender was **Deutsche Bank**, which had about **$340 million extended to Trump** across three properties – Trump National Doral (Miami), Trump Tower Chicago, and the D.C. hotel – all **due in 2023 or 2024** ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=The%20Doral%20resort%20and%20Washington,Reuters%20on%20condition%20of%20anonymity)). Another significant liability was a **$160 million mortgage on 40 Wall Street** (a commercial mortgage-backed security), of which Trump personally guaranteed $26 million ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=Trump%20took%20out%20a%20%24160,can%E2%80%99t%20cover%20its%20debt%20payments)). That loan, due in 2025, became troubled as the building’s cash flow fell below required levels in 2020–21 ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=The%20property%E2%80%99s%20financials%20have%20tumbled,risky%20territory%2C%20the%20reports%20say)). Trump Tower (New York) also had a $100 million loan (from 2012) scheduled to mature in 2022. In total, Trump faced **hundreds of millions in debt payments** in the early 2020s, heightening the importance of refinancing or asset sales ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=each%20in%202016%20and%202017)). Notably, many loans were personally guaranteed by Trump, meaning a default could have put him on the hook and forced sales of marquee properties.

- **Bank Relationships and Refinancing:** Trump’s polarizing presidency left him with **fewer willing bankers** by 2021. In the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot, **Deutsche Bank – Trump’s primary bank – announced it would not extend Trump further credit or refinance his loans** when they came due ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=The%20Doral%20resort%20and%20Washington,Reuters%20on%20condition%20of%20anonymity)). Other institutions also severed ties (e.g. Signature Bank closed Trump accounts) amid reputational concerns. This presented a risk that Trump would **struggle to refinance** looming debts on properties that had declined in performance. Trump’s team sought out nontraditional lenders and workarounds. For example, **Deutsche Bank had quietly given Trump a six-year extension on paying principal** for the $170 million D.C. hotel loan in 2018 ([Trump Received 'Preferential Treatment' on Loan From Deutsche Bank: House Oversight - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-received-preferential-treatment-on-loan-from-deutsche-bank-house-oversight-2021-10#:~:text=The%20documents%20show%20Deutsche%20Bank,committee%20said%20in%20a%20statement)) – effectively a grace period until 2024, which House investigators later flagged as “undisclosed preferential treatment” from a foreign bank while Trump was president ([Trump Received 'Preferential Treatment' on Loan From Deutsche Bank: House Oversight - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-received-preferential-treatment-on-loan-from-deutsche-bank-house-oversight-2021-10#:~:text=,the%20committee%20said)) ([Trump Received 'Preferential Treatment' on Loan From Deutsche Bank: House Oversight - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-received-preferential-treatment-on-loan-from-deutsche-bank-house-oversight-2021-10#:~:text=The%20documents%20show%20Deutsche%20Bank,committee%20said%20in%20a%20statement)). This deferral eased short-term cash needs (interest-only payments for six years) but meant a **large balloon payment** at maturity ([Trump Received 'Preferential Treatment' on Loan From Deutsche Bank: House Oversight - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-received-preferential-treatment-on-loan-from-deutsche-bank-house-oversight-2021-10#:~:text=,which%20will%20be%20in%202024)) ([Trump Received 'Preferential Treatment' on Loan From Deutsche Bank: House Oversight - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-received-preferential-treatment-on-loan-from-deutsche-bank-house-oversight-2021-10#:~:text=financial%20statements%20certifying%20them%20to,which%20will%20be%20in%202024)). By 2021, with Deutsche Bank exiting, Trump had to seek new financing sources. *(Indeed, after our period, in 2022 he refinanced Trump Tower’s debt through a smaller lender, Axos Bank, and sold the D.C. hotel lease – moves indicating how he ultimately addressed these obligations.)*

- **Cash Infusions and Asset Monetization:** To bolster liquidity, the Trump Organization **tapped into its assets and partnerships**. In early 2021, **Vornado Realty Trust (Trump’s 30% partner in two office towers)** completed a refinancing of one property – 555 California Street in San Francisco – via a $1.2 billion bond deal ([Trump and Vornado Realty Trust to Receive $617 Million Windfall: Reports - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-vornado-realty-trust-windfall-financing-new-york-california-2021-5#:~:text=,stories%20on%20Insider%27s%20business%20page)) ([Trump and Vornado Realty Trust to Receive $617 Million Windfall: Reports - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-vornado-realty-trust-windfall-financing-new-york-california-2021-5#:~:text=which%20on%20Friday%20sold%20%241,in%20bonds%2C%20according%20to%20Bloomberg)). The refinancing allowed Vornado and Trump’s holding to **pull out about $617 million in cash** to split among investors ([Trump and Vornado Realty Trust to Receive $617 Million Windfall: Reports - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-vornado-realty-trust-windfall-financing-new-york-california-2021-5#:~:text=,stories%20on%20Insider%27s%20business%20page)) ([Trump and Vornado Realty Trust to Receive $617 Million Windfall: Reports - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-vornado-realty-trust-windfall-financing-new-york-california-2021-5#:~:text=which%20on%20Friday%20sold%20%241,in%20bonds%2C%20according%20to%20Bloomberg)). Trump’s share of that windfall was not publicly disclosed, but **Eric Trump confirmed roughly $162 million was distributed to the Trump business** from the refinance ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=Eric%20Trump%2C%20the%20former%20president%E2%80%99s,tab%2C%20the%20venture%E2%80%99s%20majority%20owner)). “We’re sitting on a tremendous amount of cash,” Eric Trump told Reuters in October 2021 ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=Eric%20Trump%2C%20the%20former%20president%E2%80%99s,tab%2C%20the%20venture%E2%80%99s%20majority%20owner)), referring to this infusion. This cash was a critical buffer for upcoming loan payments. In addition, Trump’s 2019 sale of the Beverly Hills property for $13.5 million (noted above) and the **planned sale of the D.C. hotel lease** were part of a strategy to raise cash to **pay down or pay off debts**. By late 2021, the D.C. hotel was under contract to be sold for a reported $375 million (a deal closed in 2022), which would eliminate the $170 million Deutsche Bank loan on that property and potentially net the Trumps a profit ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=Trump%20is%20now%20making%20a,than%20%2473%20million%20since%202016)).

- **Debt Reduction vs. New Ventures:** Despite these efforts, Trump still carried substantial leverage. His **personal financial filings for 2020** (published in early 2021) reflected outstanding debts in the **hundreds of millions** to various creditors ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=each%20in%202016%20and%202017)). However, those same disclosures (and the 2020 NYT investigation) suggested Trump had **“very little debt relative to value,”** as his representatives often claimed ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=number%20indicating%20that%20the%20building%E2%80%99s,can%E2%80%99t%20cover%20its%20debt%20payments)) ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=In%20the%20statement%20for%20Trump%2C,doing%20very%20well%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20said)). That assertion assumes Trump’s real estate values rebound and that recent refinancings extend maturities. The **IRS audit of Trump’s $72.9 million tax refund** also loomed as a potential liability – if the IRS ruled against Trump’s claim, he could owe **over $100 million** in back taxes and interest ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=each%20in%202016%20and%202017)), further straining liquidity. Trump’s ability to generate new revenue (discussed below) would be vital to servicing his debt. In 2021, he pursued opportunities like a high-dollar SPAC deal for a new media venture as a way to inject cash into his empire, which, if successful, could indirectly aid his debt situation.

In summary, **Trump managed to stave off a debt crisis during 2018–2021 through deferrals, refinancings, and asset sales**, but the fundamental challenge remained: many Trump properties were over-leveraged and underperforming, requiring continuous attention to avoid defaults. By the end of 2021, with significant loans still on the horizon, Trump’s financial team had secured some breathing room (and cash stockpiles), but **long-term solutions** depended on improving business or finding new income streams in the post-presidency era.

## Revenue Sources & Income Streams

Trump’s revenue streams in 2018–2021 were diverse – ranging from property income and **business sales, to royalties and other earnings** – but they also reflected the shift in his career from entertainer to public official. A major investigative report in 2020 detailed how, in earlier years, Trump’s **celebrity income from NBC’s *The Apprentice*** had provided a huge “financial lifeline” while many of his real estate ventures lost money ([Donald Trump Raked in $427 Million on 'the Apprentice': NYT - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-raked-in-427-million-on-the-apprentice-nyt-2020-9#:~:text=,but)) ([Donald Trump Raked in $427 Million on 'the Apprentice': NYT - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-raked-in-427-million-on-the-apprentice-nyt-2020-9#:~:text=,Insider%27s%20homepage%20for%20more%20stories)). By 2018, however, those entertainment earnings had largely dried up, placing more weight on **traditional business revenues**. Key components of Trump’s income during this period included:

- **Real Estate Operations:** The **primary source of revenue** for Trump in 2018–21 was the operating income (or in some cases, simply gross revenue) from his real estate and resort properties. This includes **hotel room revenues, golf course fees, condominium sales, commercial rents, and club memberships.** For example, Trump’s 2018 federal disclosure claimed total business revenues of at least $434.9 million ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=The%20details%20of%20the%20tax,4%20million%20loss)) (though his tax filings for that year showed a $47.4 million loss, due to deductions and depreciation ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=Trump%2C%20who%20has%20fiercely%20guarded,of%20the%20past%2015%20years)) ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=The%20details%20of%20the%20tax,4%20million%20loss))). In the first two years of his presidency, Trump’s businesses received **$73 million from foreign operations alone** (such as his golf clubs in Scotland and hotel partnerships in the Philippines and India) ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=During%20his%20first%20two%20years,income%20taxes)). This included about **$3 million from the Philippines, $2.3 million from India, and $1 million from Turkey** in 2017–18 ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=During%20his%20first%20two%20years,income%20taxes)) – highlighting how overseas projects and licensing deals contributed to his income even while he was in the Oval Office. Domestically, marquee properties like **Trump Tower (NYC)** and **Trump National Doral** generated tens of millions in revenue each year, albeit often offset by expenses. **Mar-a-Lago** saw increased resort income as membership and event fees rose with Trump’s presidency. It’s important to note that revenue != profit: Trump’s taxes revealed that **many of these businesses ran at a loss or broke even** after expenses, which is how he legally avoided income tax in many years ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=Trump%2C%20who%20has%20fiercely%20guarded,of%20the%20past%2015%20years)) ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=each%20in%202016%20and%202017)). Nonetheless, these operating revenues maintained cash flow for the Trump Organization and serviced debt.

- **Licensing & Branding Deals:** Prior to office, Trump’s licensing of his name to real estate projects worldwide was a lucrative, low-overhead revenue stream. During 2018–2021, **ongoing licensing deals** continued to bring in money, though at a diminished scale. Trump had lent his name to luxury towers in places like **India, Turkey, the Philippines, Uruguay, and elsewhere**, usually in exchange for upfront fees and a share of sales or profits. For instance, Istanbul’s Trump Towers (owned by a Turkish conglomerate) pays Trump’s company licensing fees (Turkish developers paid up to $10 million for the naming rights in 2010) – some of that revenue persisted through 2018–21, creating potential conflicts as Turkish policy decisions could affect Trump’s income. In the **Philippines**, Trump licensed his brand to the Trump Tower in Manila and formed a relationship with developer Jose Antonio (who was even appointed a special government envoy to the U.S. under Philippine President Duterte), meaning Trump earned **millions from Philippine real estate while president** ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=During%20his%20first%20two%20years,income%20taxes)). **India became Trump’s largest foreign market** for licensing: projects in Mumbai, Pune, Kolkata, and Gurgaon bore his name, and Trump Jr.’s 2018 India trip (with its controversial marketing) underscored that **India generated significant condo sales commissions or royalties for the Trumps** ([Donald Trump Jr. visits India to help sell apartments | MPR News](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/02/20/donald-trump-jr-visits-india-to-help-sell-apartments#:~:text=The%20newspaper%20ads%20promise%20that,a%20day%20later)) ([Donald Trump Jr. visits India to help sell apartments | MPR News](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/02/20/donald-trump-jr-visits-india-to-help-sell-apartments#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%20Jr,Trump%20brand%20real%20estate%20projects)). However, **no new licensing deals** were signed during the presidency to avoid overt violations of Trump’s pledge (deals in India and Indonesia were technically pre-existing). After leaving office, Trump signaled interest in new branding ventures (for example, exploring a new hotel brand targeting his political base), but as of 2021 none had yet materialized ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=Experts%20say%20the%20prospect%20of,Trump%20name%20on%20their%20properties)) ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=Experts%20say%20the%20prospect%20of,Trump%20name%20on%20their%20properties)).

- **Entertainment & Media Residuals:** Trump’s previously massive entertainment income dwindled during this period. According to the NY Times analysis, Trump earned a total of **$427 million from *The Apprentice*** reality show and related endorsements/licensing from 2004 to the late 2010s ([Donald Trump Raked in $427 Million on 'the Apprentice': NYT - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-raked-in-427-million-on-the-apprentice-nyt-2020-9#:~:text=,than%20%243%20million%20in%202018)) ([Donald Trump Raked in $427 Million on 'the Apprentice': NYT - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-raked-in-427-million-on-the-apprentice-nyt-2020-9#:~:text=,but)). This included $197 million from NBC for hosting the show and a further $230 million from “Trump” branded merchandise and events turbocharged by his TV fame ([Donald Trump Raked in $427 Million on 'the Apprentice': NYT - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-raked-in-427-million-on-the-apprentice-nyt-2020-9#:~:text=,but)). However, *The Apprentice* ended in 2015, and by 2018 Trump’s income from television and fame had fallen sharply – dropping from **$51 million in 2011 to less than $3 million in 2018** ([Donald Trump Raked in $427 Million on 'the Apprentice': NYT - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-raked-in-427-million-on-the-apprentice-nyt-2020-9#:~:text=,Insider%27s%20homepage%20for%20more%20stories)) ([Donald Trump Raked in $427 Million on 'the Apprentice': NYT - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-raked-in-427-million-on-the-apprentice-nyt-2020-9#:~:text=Trump%27s%20income%20from%20,after%20exiting%20it%20in%202015)). In other words, by his presidency, **Trump’s celebrity cash stream had largely dried up**, aside from minor Screen Actors Guild pensions or residuals. Trump did earn book royalties on older titles (and in 2019 he received a one-time $5 million advance for a yet-to-be-written book, per disclosures), but he did not publish any memoir or new bestseller while in office. In 2021, however, Trump did capitalize on his presidential notoriety with a high-priced picture book (“Our Journey Together”) which quickly sold out – an example of him converting political fame back into personal revenue in the post-presidency.

- **Business Divestitures and Other Income:** Occasionally, Trump’s income got a boost from **asset sales or one-off transactions**. For example, the **sale of the California property** and other smaller real estate sales contributed capital gains. Additionally, **investment income** – Trump held various brokerage and trust accounts – showed up in disclosures (though he claimed to have sold all stocks by 2016, he may have had interest income or profits from investments like the Vornado partnership). Trump also chose to **forgo his Presidential salary** of $400,000 (donating it to agencies each quarter, as he publicized), meaning he did not add that small income to his coffers. Meanwhile, his campaign and political committees raised hundreds of millions from donors, but legally those funds are separate (used for campaign or PAC purposes, not personal spending, aside from covering some travel or legal expenses). After leaving office, Trump formed a PAC that raised $100+ million in 2021; while not “income” to Trump, such funds solidified his **financial backing for political and legal fights** ahead.

Overall, **Trump’s revenue mix shifted to rely almost entirely on his business operations by 2018–2021**, just as those operations were under strain. The huge windfalls from his reality-TV fame were gone (shrinking to negligible levels by 2020 ([Donald Trump Raked in $427 Million on 'the Apprentice': NYT - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-raked-in-427-million-on-the-apprentice-nyt-2020-9#:~:text=,Insider%27s%20homepage%20for%20more%20stories))), and any *new* lucrative deals were hampered by ethics constraints and Trump’s controversial profile. In fact, Trump’s tax filings famously showed **years of carried-forward losses** that often wiped out any taxable income ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=Trump%2C%20who%20has%20fiercely%20guarded,of%20the%20past%2015%20years)) ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=Trump%20found%20multiple%20ways%20to,other%20entities%20with%20multiple%20owners)). During his presidency, he reported paying **just $750 in federal income tax in 2016 and 2017** and $0 in many other years ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=President%20Donald%20Trump%20paid%20just,in%20the%20New%20York%20Times)) ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=Trump%2C%20who%20has%20fiercely%20guarded,of%20the%20past%2015%20years)) – not because he had no revenue, but because **write-offs from money-losing businesses (like many of his golf courses) offset profitable streams**. This strategy, legal under tax law, meant that even as Trump’s hotels and licensing deals generated *gross* income, his *net* income remained modest or negative on paper.

One striking data point: during 2017–2018 (first two years in office), Trump’s businesses had roughly **$1.6 billion in total revenue**, of which about **$160 million was from foreign sources** ([Trump likely benefited from $13.6 million in payments from foreign governments during his presidency - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/trump-likely-benefited-from-13-6-million-in-payments-from-foreign-governments-during-his-presidency/#:~:text=As%20CREW%20has%20previously%20reported%2C,focus%20on%20in%20this%20report)) ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=During%20his%20first%20two%20years,income%20taxes)). This underscores that **90% of Trump’s revenue as President came from U.S. properties and deals**, but that 10% from overseas could pose conflicts. Looking forward from 2021, Trump’s ability to **monetize his post-presidential brand** – through ventures like media platforms, speaking engagements, or new partnerships – stood to significantly impact his revenue in subsequent years. Indeed, late 2021 saw Trump launch a major new venture (a social media startup) aimed at leveraging his popularity for profit, as discussed in the *Post-Presidency* section.

## International Business Ties & Foreign Dealings

Trump’s business footprint has been global, and **2018–2021 saw continued controversy over his international ties**. During his presidency, Trump **did not fully divest** from his overseas business interests, which led to heightened scrutiny of how foreign governments or partners might influence or enrich the President’s private ventures. Here we examine Trump’s notable foreign business dealings in this period and the legal, political, and ethical questions around them:

- **Ongoing Foreign Projects:** *“No new foreign deals”* was the mantra Trump’s team announced in January 2017 to avoid conflicts. In practice, **Trump Org continued to pursue pre-existing foreign projects** and sometimes expanded them. **India** was the most active: the Trump Organization had licensing or management agreements for at least four luxury residential projects in India. In February 2018, Donald Trump Jr. traveled to India to promote Trump-branded condominiums, a tour that blurred lines by offering purchasers an exclusive meeting with the President’s son ([Donald Trump Jr. visits India to help sell apartments | MPR News](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/02/20/donald-trump-jr-visits-india-to-help-sell-apartments#:~:text=The%20ads%2C%20which%20have%20run,development%20outside%20the%20Indian%20capital)) ([Donald Trump Jr. visits India to help sell apartments | MPR News](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/02/20/donald-trump-jr-visits-india-to-help-sell-apartments#:~:text=The%20newspaper%20ads%20promise%20that,a%20day%20later)). Full-page newspaper ads proclaimed “Trump has arrived. Have you?” – touting Trump Jr.’s visit in a way that traded on the presidential name to boost sales ([Donald Trump Jr. visits India to help sell apartments | MPR News](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/02/20/donald-trump-jr-visits-india-to-help-sell-apartments#:~:text=The%20ads%2C%20which%20have%20run,development%20outside%20the%20Indian%20capital)). Ethics experts called the sales pitch (**“buy a flat, meet Trump Jr.”**) a blatant conflict of interest, since it leveraged Trump’s public office for private gain ([Donald Trump Jr. visits India to help sell apartments | MPR News](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/02/20/donald-trump-jr-visits-india-to-help-sell-apartments#:~:text=The%20newspaper%20ads%20promise%20that,a%20day%20later)). Nevertheless, Indian developers reported strong demand, and Trump Org earned millions in licensing fees and commissions from these deals. In **Indonesia**, two major resort developments (one near Jakarta, one in Bali) with Trump branding progressed. In 2018 it emerged that the Chinese government’s Metallurgical Corporation had agreed to help finance a theme park in the Jakarta project with **$500 million in loans** – a project which included Trump-branded hotels and a golf course ([Trump ZTE Order Comes After China Gave Millions to Trump Organization-Tied Project - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-zte-order-after-china-gave-millions-to-trump-organization-tied-project-2018-5#:~:text=)) ([Trump ZTE Order Comes After China Gave Millions to Trump Organization-Tied Project - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-zte-order-after-china-gave-millions-to-trump-organization-tied-project-2018-5#:~:text=the%20developer%20of%20that%20project,hotels%20and%20a%20golf%20course)). Only days after this Chinese financing was reported, President Trump made a controversial intervention to lift U.S. sanctions on Chinese telecom giant ZTE ([Trump ZTE Order Comes After China Gave Millions to Trump Organization-Tied Project - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-zte-order-after-china-gave-millions-to-trump-organization-tied-project-2018-5#:~:text=)) ([Trump ZTE Order Comes After China Gave Millions to Trump Organization-Tied Project - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-zte-order-after-china-gave-millions-to-trump-organization-tied-project-2018-5#:~:text=the%20developer%20of%20that%20project,hotels%20and%20a%20golf%20course)). Lawmakers from both parties cried foul, suggesting **Trump’s policy decision might have been influenced by his private business interest** (a potential violation of the U.S. Constitution’s Emoluments Clause, which prohibits accepting benefits from foreign states) ([Trump ZTE Order Comes After China Gave Millions to Trump Organization-Tied Project - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-zte-order-after-china-gave-millions-to-trump-organization-tied-project-2018-5#:~:text=)) ([Trump ZTE Order Comes After China Gave Millions to Trump Organization-Tied Project - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-zte-order-after-china-gave-millions-to-trump-organization-tied-project-2018-5#:~:text=the%20developer%20of%20that%20project,hotels%20and%20a%20golf%20course)). The Trump Organization claimed the timing was coincidental, but the incident exemplified the risks in Trump’s international entanglements.

- **Licensing in Authoritarian Countries:** Trump’s name remained on properties in countries with authoritarian-leaning regimes, raising questions about leverage. In **Turkey**, Trump had a lucrative licensing deal for Trump Towers Istanbul. He admitted in 2019, *“I have a little conflict of interest [in] Turkey,”* noting the Turks were “great people” who *“pay me a lot of money”* ([Trump likely benefited from $13.6 million in payments from foreign governments during his presidency - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/trump-likely-benefited-from-13-6-million-in-payments-from-foreign-governments-during-his-presidency/#:~:text=The%20totals%20in%20this%20report,Thus%2C%20in)) ([Trump likely benefited from $13.6 million in payments from foreign governments during his presidency - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/trump-likely-benefited-from-13-6-million-in-payments-from-foreign-governments-during-his-presidency/#:~:text=to%20%24160%20million%20%20from,focus%20on%20in%20this%20report)). During 2018–2019, as U.S.-Turkey relations seesawed (e.g. over Syria policy and a Turkish bank sanctions case), observers wondered if Trump’s business interests influenced his soft approach to Turkey’s president. Similarly, in **the Philippines**, Trump’s partner (Century Properties’ head Jose E.B. Antonio) was appointed special envoy to the U.S. shortly after Trump’s 2016 election – an unusual intersection of business and diplomacy. Trump earned several million dollars from the Manila Trump Tower project while President ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=During%20his%20first%20two%20years,income%20taxes)), at the same time as he praised Philippines’ Duterte and overlooked human rights issues, prompting speculation about **curry-favor dynamics**. 

- **Foreign Government Patronage & Emoluments:** One of the most direct ways foreign ties played out was **foreign governments spending at Trump’s U.S. properties**. The D.C. hotel became a magnet for foreign officials: e.g., embassies and delegations from countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Malaysia, and others hosted events or booked blocks of rooms there. House investigators later documented **over $3.7 million in payments from foreign governments to the Trump International Hotel in D.C.** during 2017–2020 ([Trump Received 'Preferential Treatment' on Loan From Deutsche Bank: House Oversight - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-received-preferential-treatment-on-loan-from-deutsche-bank-house-oversight-2021-10#:~:text=,the%20committee%20said)). These included large tabs like a Malaysian official’s $259,000 hotel bill and Saudi-funded lobbyists spending $270,000 in early 2017 ([Trump Received 'Preferential Treatment' on Loan From Deutsche Bank: House Oversight - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-received-preferential-treatment-on-loan-from-deutsche-bank-house-oversight-2021-10#:~:text=,the%20committee%20said)). Such patronage raised the specter of **foreign influence**: were countries spending at Trump’s hotel to gain favorable treatment from the U.S. government? Multiple lawsuits were filed under the **“Foreign Emoluments Clause”** of the Constitution, which bars federal officials from accepting things of value from foreign states without Congressional consent. Trump fought these lawsuits, calling the Emoluments Clause “phony” ([Trump Received 'Preferential Treatment' on Loan From Deutsche Bank: House Oversight - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-received-preferential-treatment-on-loan-from-deutsche-bank-house-oversight-2021-10#:~:text=Trump%27s%20refusal%20to%20divest%20himself,distance%20himself%20from%20his%20businesses)) ([Trump Received 'Preferential Treatment' on Loan From Deutsche Bank: House Oversight - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-received-preferential-treatment-on-loan-from-deutsche-bank-house-oversight-2021-10#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20Trump%20called%20the,accused%20him%20of%20violating%20it)). The legal cases were ultimately dismissed in 2021 (after Trump left office, courts deemed them moot), but not before Trump had to turn over financial data in discovery. Those records showed, for example, that one **foreign embassy paid the Trump Hotel $10,500 for a one-night stay** in 2017 – far above normal rates ([Trump Organization charged Secret Service $1.4M to stay at his ...](https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-organization-charged-secret-service-14m-stay-properties/story?id=91640350#:~:text=Trump%20Organization%20charged%20Secret%20Service,properties%20over%20669%20expenditures)) ([Trump Organization charged Secret Service $1.4M to stay at his ...](https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-organization-charged-secret-service-14m-stay-properties/story?id=91640350#:~:text=,properties%20over%20669%20expenditures)). 

- **Investigations of Foreign Deals:** Trump’s foreign business ties also drew investigative scrutiny. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe (2017–2019) examined whether any of Trump’s business dealings related to Russia might have influenced the 2016 election. It came to light that **Trump pursued a Trump Tower Moscow project through June 2016**, with his lawyer Michael Cohen even contacting the Kremlin – a deal that could have been hugely lucrative ([Trump likely benefited from $13.6 million in payments from foreign governments during his presidency - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/trump-likely-benefited-from-13-6-million-in-payments-from-foreign-governments-during-his-presidency/#:~:text=significant%20portions%20of%20the%20spending,history%E2%80%94but%20provide%20no%20spending%20details)). Cohen’s 2019 testimony to Congress, and subsequent investigations by New York authorities, raised questions about whether Trump had **misled the public about his foreign business pursuits**. While the Moscow deal never materialized, the fact that Trump was negotiating a possible **$300 million Moscow tower licensing deal** during the campaign (and offered Putin a penthouse) showed his willingness to do business in geopolitically sensitive locales. Separately, Trump’s past project in **Azerbaijan** (a Baku hotel developed with oligarch-linked partners) and an aborted venture in **Georgia** drew attention for possible money-laundering concerns ([Trump likely benefited from $13.6 million in payments from foreign governments during his presidency - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/trump-likely-benefited-from-13-6-million-in-payments-from-foreign-governments-during-his-presidency/#:~:text=significant%20portions%20of%20the%20spending,history%E2%80%94but%20provide%20no%20spending%20details)) ([Trump likely benefited from $13.6 million in payments from foreign governments during his presidency - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/trump-likely-benefited-from-13-6-million-in-payments-from-foreign-governments-during-his-presidency/#:~:text=part%20of%20Qatar%E2%80%99s%20spending%20at,history%E2%80%94but%20provide%20no%20spending%20details)). Though these projects were mostly in the past, their shadows lingered. In 2021, for instance, the **Scottish Parliament debated an “Unexplained Wealth Order”** to investigate how Trump financed his cash purchases of Turnberry and Aberdeenshire golf resorts in 2014 ([Scottish parliament rejects call for Trump wealth order | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/scottish-parliament-rejects-call-trump-wealth-order-2021-02-03/#:~:text=LONDON%2C%20Feb%203%20%28Reuters%29%20,president%27s%20sons)) ([Scottish parliament rejects call for Trump wealth order | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/scottish-parliament-rejects-call-trump-wealth-order-2021-02-03/#:~:text=The%20party%27s%20co,Scotland%20should%20never%20have%20associated)). The motion (driven by concerns of possible laundering or hidden financing) was voted down in Feb 2021 ([Scottish parliament rejects call for Trump wealth order | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/scottish-parliament-rejects-call-trump-wealth-order-2021-02-03/#:~:text=LONDON%2C%20Feb%203%20%28Reuters%29%20,president%27s%20sons)), but a citizen group continued to push for a probe. Eric Trump derided the idea as “pathetic”, yet the episode underscored that **Trump’s international investments remained under a cloud of suspicion**.

- **Post-Presidency Foreign Deals:** After leaving office, Trump indicated he was open for business again internationally. In 2021, the Trump Org reportedly entered talks for a deal in the **Middle East** (a Saudi-based golf partnership). Indeed, by late 2021 Trump had agreed to host Saudi-funded **LIV Golf tournaments** at his courses (a venture that became public in 2022). Also, **trademark approvals** that foreign governments granted to Trump’s companies during his presidency (such as in China, where Trump was suddenly awarded 18 trademarks in 2017 ([Trump likely benefited from $13.6 million in payments from foreign governments during his presidency - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/trump-likely-benefited-from-13-6-million-in-payments-from-foreign-governments-during-his-presidency/#:~:text=The%20totals%20in%20this%20report,Thus%2C%20in))) came to fruition – these could facilitate future business in those countries. For example, one of Trump’s China trademarks was for construction services, hinting at potential real estate branding there post-office. Critics point out that foreign governments might have **granted Trump favors (like fast-tracking trademarks or permits)** while he was in power as an attempt to ingratiate themselves ([Trump likely benefited from $13.6 million in payments from foreign governments during his presidency - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/trump-likely-benefited-from-13-6-million-in-payments-from-foreign-governments-during-his-presidency/#:~:text=all,are%20known%20but%20difficult%20or)) ([Trump likely benefited from $13.6 million in payments from foreign governments during his presidency - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/trump-likely-benefited-from-13-6-million-in-payments-from-foreign-governments-during-his-presidency/#:~:text=county%20where%20one%20of%20his,part%20of%20our%20overall%20total)). In office, Trump famously *praised* countries where he had business (Turkey, India, China to some extent) and *lashed out* at those where he didn’t (or which targeted his interests, like the UK when Britain’s parliament debated banning him from entering in 2016, he retaliated by threatening to pull investment). 

In conclusion, **Trump’s international business ties from 2018–2021 presented unprecedented conflict-of-interest concerns**. He stood to earn (and in many cases did earn) money from foreign enterprises and governments while setting U.S. foreign policy. Although no smoking-gun quid pro quo was legally proven during his term, the **appearance of potential foreign influence was pervasive** ([Trump Received 'Preferential Treatment' on Loan From Deutsche Bank: House Oversight - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-received-preferential-treatment-on-loan-from-deutsche-bank-house-oversight-2021-10#:~:text=,the%20committee%20said)) ([Trump Received 'Preferential Treatment' on Loan From Deutsche Bank: House Oversight - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-received-preferential-treatment-on-loan-from-deutsche-bank-house-oversight-2021-10#:~:text=Trump%27s%20refusal%20to%20divest%20himself,distance%20himself%20from%20his%20businesses)). Ethics watchdogs documented at least **$13.6 million in known payments from foreign governments to Trump’s businesses during his presidency** ([Trump likely benefited from $13.6 million in payments from foreign governments during his presidency - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/trump-likely-benefited-from-13-6-million-in-payments-from-foreign-governments-during-his-presidency/#:~:text=%2413,should%20he%20return%20to%20the)) – a conservative tally that doesn’t even include all the indirect benefits and deals. These entanglements were a constant backdrop to Trump’s foreign policy decisions and remain an area of legal exposure (e.g. a DC lawsuit over Trump’s Inaugural Committee spending at the Trump Hotel, which alleged overcharging to the benefit of Trump’s business, was ongoing into 2021). Trump’s case illustrated how deeply **business and governance intertwined** when a global businessman became U.S. president.

## Legal & Tax Matters (Lawsuits, Audits & Investigations)

Donald Trump’s finances in 2018–2021 were subject to intense legal scrutiny – from **tax audits and congressional inquiries to law enforcement investigations and civil lawsuits**. Much of this stemmed from questions about whether Trump misrepresented his financial positions, violated laws, or abused his office for gain. Below is an overview of major legal and tax-related developments:

- **Tax Returns & IRS Audit:** A focal point was Trump’s **tax returns**, which he broke with tradition by refusing to release. In 2020, the *New York Times* obtained decades of his tax data, publishing bombshell findings: Trump paid only **$750 in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017** ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=President%20Donald%20Trump%20paid%20just,in%20the%20New%20York%20Times)), and $0 in ten out of fifteen years prior, largely due to reporting **huge business losses** ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=Trump%2C%20who%20has%20fiercely%20guarded,of%20the%20past%2015%20years)). In 2018, though Trump’s public disclosure indicated at least $434 million in income, his tax return actually showed a **$47.4 million loss** ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=The%20details%20of%20the%20tax,4%20million%20loss)) – highlighting a pattern of losses offsetting income. The Times also revealed Trump had, starting in 2010, claimed a **$72.9 million tax refund** from the IRS (related to prior losses), which was **under audit** in 2018–20. An adverse ruling in that audit could cost Trump over $100 million ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=each%20in%202016%20and%202017)). This audit remained unresolved as of 2021, and was a significant financial contingency. The tax revelations led to public outrage and demands for accountability. Trump faced questions about **deductions** he took – such as writing off $70,000 for hair styling for *The Apprentice* ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=in%20the%20Philippines%2C%20compared%20with,income%20taxes)) – and whether those were legitimate business expenses. They also raised national security flags, as **Trump owed over $300 million in personally guaranteed debt** (per the tax data) and had **income from abroad**, which former intelligence officials argued could pose a conflict or even a leverage risk ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=each%20in%202016%20and%202017)) ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=During%20his%20first%20two%20years,income%20taxes)). On the legal front, in 2019 the House Ways and Means Committee subpoenaed Trump’s tax returns under a law permitting congressional review of IRS audits. Trump litigated fiercely to block Congress and the Manhattan District Attorney from obtaining his returns. These battles went to the Supreme Court twice. In July 2020 and again in February 2021, the Supreme Court ruled against Trump’s objections, allowing the Manhattan D.A. (Cyrus Vance Jr.) to obtain Trump’s tax records and work papers from his accounting firm (Mazars USA) ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=Weisselberg%2C%20have%20been%20charged%20with,and%20are%20contesting%20the%20charges)). (Congressional access was delayed until 2022.) Thus by early 2021, Trump’s closely guarded financials were in the hands of investigators, setting the stage for potential legal trouble.

- **Manhattan D.A. Criminal Investigation:** The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office conducted a **criminal investigation into Trump and the Trump Organization’s financial practices**. Initially focused on hush-money payments (to Stormy Daniels in 2016) and potential campaign finance violations, the probe expanded by 2019 to examine whether Trump’s company **committed bank, tax, or insurance fraud** – essentially, whether it **inflated asset values when seeking loans but deflated values for tax benefits**. In 2021, after acquiring Trump’s tax returns and internal records, D.A. Vance (and New York Attorney General Letitia James, who joined as an acting deputy) honed in on fringe benefits given to Trump Organization executives. In **July 2021, the Trump Organization and its longtime CFO Allen Weisselberg were indicted** on 15 felony counts, including grand larceny and tax fraud ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=Weisselberg%2C%20have%20been%20charged%20with,and%20are%20contesting%20the%20charges)). Prosecutors alleged that from 2005–2021, the company had orchestrated a scheme to compensate executives “off the books” by paying perks like apartments, cars, and private school tuition without reporting them as income ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=Weisselberg%2C%20have%20been%20charged%20with,and%20are%20contesting%20the%20charges)). Weisselberg alone was accused of evading taxes on $1.7 million in perks ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=Weisselberg%2C%20have%20been%20charged%20with,and%20are%20contesting%20the%20charges)). The indictment painted the Trump Org as a **15-year tax fraud enterprise**, though charges at that time did not directly implicate Donald Trump personally. Weisselberg pleaded not guilty (he later changed his plea to guilty in 2022 and testified against the company). The company also pleaded not guilty and fought the charges in court (ultimately, in late 2022, a jury convicted the Trump Org on all counts). Throughout 2021, the D.A.’s team also pressured Weisselberg to flip on Trump and probed whether Trump or his family had **knowingly falsified business records** – an investigation that continued beyond Vance’s retirement in 2021. By the end of our period, Trump himself had not been charged, but the criminal investigation was active, with a special grand jury convened. The legal expenses and risks for Trump were significant, and he **repeatedly called the New York investigations a “witch hunt,”** accusing prosecutors of political bias.

- **New York Attorney General Civil Inquiry:** Separately, NY AG **Letitia James pursued a civil investigation** into the Trump Organization for potential fraud. Triggered in part by Michael Cohen’s 2019 congressional testimony (where Cohen said Trump would fraudulently misstate values), James’s probe examined many of the same properties for **possible misrepresentation on financial statements**. By 2020, James had filed motions to compel documents and depositions. In 2021, her office revealed some findings: they asserted that Trump’s company **“grossly exaggerated” property values in statements to lenders and insurers** ([Trump Received 'Preferential Treatment' on Loan From Deutsche Bank: House Oversight - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-received-preferential-treatment-on-loan-from-deutsche-bank-house-oversight-2021-10#:~:text=million%20to%20aid%20the%20struggling,hotel)) ([Trump Received 'Preferential Treatment' on Loan From Deutsche Bank: House Oversight - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-received-preferential-treatment-on-loan-from-deutsche-bank-house-oversight-2021-10#:~:text=The%20committee%20said%20that%20Trump,party%20loans)). For instance, Trump Org provided banks with **“Statements of Financial Condition”** that claimed Trump’s triplex apartment was 30,000 sq. ft. (when it was 10,000) and valued it at $327 million (far above any NYC apartment sale). They also examined dubious valuations like Trump’s Seven Springs estate in NY and the value of his branding on deals. In May 2021, the NY AG’s office publicly announced that its inquiry, while civil, was now working “in a criminal capacity” with the Manhattan D.A. as well ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=Weisselberg%2C%20have%20been%20charged%20with,and%20are%20contesting%20the%20charges)). This signaled increased legal peril. James subpoenaed Donald Trump, Don Jr., and Ivanka in late 2021 for depositions (leading to a court battle in early 2022). Though the civil case had not reached conclusion by 2021, James would eventually (in 2022) file a sweeping lawsuit seeking $250 million in penalties and banning the Trumps from doing NY business, based on evidence gathered in this period. Thus, during 2018–21 Trump faced the prospect of **civil fraud charges that could hit his wallet and ability to operate** in New York.

- **Lawsuits Over Conflicts of Interest:** Trump was also beset by lawsuits alleging that he violated anti-corruption provisions. The **Attorneys General of D.C. and Maryland filed suits in 2017** arguing that Trump’s ownership of the D.C. hotel led to violations of the **Domestic and Foreign Emoluments Clauses**, since foreign diplomats patronized it and U.S. government agencies (e.g. State Dept., Secret Service) spent money there, benefiting the President. These cases wound through courts for years. In 2019, a federal appeals court initially dismissed one on standing grounds; another case had been allowed to proceed to evidence-gathering. By early 2021, after Trump left office, the Supreme Court declared the Emoluments litigation moot (since the remedy sought was to stop Trump from owning the businesses while president) and ordered the cases dismissed. Consequently, **no court ever ruled on the merits** of whether Trump’s business dealings ran afoul of the Constitution ([Trump Received 'Preferential Treatment' on Loan From Deutsche Bank: House Oversight - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-received-preferential-treatment-on-loan-from-deutsche-bank-house-oversight-2021-10#:~:text=Trump%27s%20refusal%20to%20divest%20himself,distance%20himself%20from%20his%20businesses)) ([Trump Received 'Preferential Treatment' on Loan From Deutsche Bank: House Oversight - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-received-preferential-treatment-on-loan-from-deutsche-bank-house-oversight-2021-10#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20Trump%20called%20the,accused%20him%20of%20violating%20it)). Still, the litigation forced some transparency – Trump Org had to disclose that it donated about $350,000 (its calculation of foreign government profits) to the U.S. Treasury for 2017 and similar amounts in subsequent years, a gesture to rebut Emoluments claims. Ethics experts however estimate that was a **fraction of the actual foreign-derived profits** ([Trump likely benefited from $13.6 million in payments from foreign governments during his presidency - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/trump-likely-benefited-from-13-6-million-in-payments-from-foreign-governments-during-his-presidency/#:~:text=%2413,should%20he%20return%20to%20the)) ([Trump likely benefited from $13.6 million in payments from foreign governments during his presidency - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/trump-likely-benefited-from-13-6-million-in-payments-from-foreign-governments-during-his-presidency/#:~:text=donated%20%24448%2C000%E2%80%94a%20fraction%20of%20the,million%20in%20payments%20documented%20here)).

- **Trump Foundation & Other Legal Matters:** In addition to business-related investigations, Trump resolved a notable case involving his charitable foundation. In 2018, the **New York Attorney General sued the Donald J. Trump Foundation** for violating nonprofit laws – alleging Trump used his charity’s funds to pay business and personal expenses (such as settling a Mar-a-Lago legal claim and buying a portrait of himself) and to boost his campaign (funneling donated money to Iowa veterans during the 2016 primaries in a poorly concealed political stunt). In late 2019, Trump agreed to **shut down the Trump Foundation and pay $2 million in damages** to a group of charities ([Judge fines Trump $2 million for misusing charity foundation](https://apnews.com/general-news-united-states-government-7b8d0f5ce9cb4cadad948c2c414afd57#:~:text=Judge%20fines%20Trump%20%242%20million,misusing%20his%20own%20charitable%20foundation)). A NY judge found Trump had breached his fiduciary duty and that the charity’s funds had been misused for Trump’s benefit ([Trump ordered to pay $2 million to settle Trump Foundation suit](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/07/trump-ordered-to-pay-2-million-to-settle-trump-foundation-suit.html#:~:text=Trump%20ordered%20to%20pay%20%242,used%20for%20Mr)). Trump was even required to undergo mandatory training for charity officers. While this was a civil matter, it added to the portrayal of **Trump’s disregard for financial laws**. During 2018–2021, Trump also faced various personal lawsuits: **defamation suits** by women accusing him of misconduct (e.g. Summer Zervos, who sued in NY – Trump fought it until she dropped it in late 2021) and **sexual assault claims** (E. Jean Carroll’s defamation case, ongoing). He fought these partly to avoid discovery into his finances and character. Additionally, committees in Congress investigated the **2021 insurrection financing**, including whether Trump’s campaign or PAC improperly raised funds with false claims – not directly a business issue for him, but a legal risk.

Through these tax and legal battles, a pattern emerged: **Trump often stalled and stonewalled, but eventually legal processes caught up to him**. By the end of 2021, he had turned over tax records to prosecutors, seen his company indicted, and paid penalties in civil cases. The financial cost was significant – legal fees and settlements – and the potential future costs (if civil fraud is proven, or if tax audits go against him) could reach into the tens or hundreds of millions. Perhaps most importantly, these legal proceedings threaten Trump’s **carefully cultivated image of wealth and success**. For instance, in early 2022, Mazars (Trump’s accounting firm) formally disavowed a decade of Trump’s financial statements as unreliable, a direct outcome of the investigations in 2018–21 (though this occurred just after our timeframe). In sum, **2018–2021 saw the veil lifted on Trump’s finances through legal action**, revealing aggressive tax avoidance, possible financial misrepresentation, and exposure to criminal charges.

## Political & Business Overlaps (Conflicts of Interest)

Trump’s simultaneous role as President and business owner from 2017–2021 created **unprecedented conflicts of interest**, and this overlap had tangible financial effects. Trump repeatedly used his public position in ways that benefited his private businesses, while controversies over conflicts colored his presidency. Here we detail the major instances of political-business overlap and their financial implications:

- **Refusal to Divest & Establishment of a Trust:** Unlike prior presidents, Trump **refused to divest his business holdings or place them in a blind trust**. Instead, he transferred management to his adult sons and an executive in early 2017, but continued to **track business performance and even promote it**. He remained the beneficiary of a revocable trust that made him aware of trust actions (e.g., he could pull money anytime, and it was reported he received quarterly updates). This meant from day one, Trump was **effectively both President and business proprietor**, setting the stage for conflicts. The **General Services Administration (GSA)**, for instance, was in the awkward spot of overseeing Trump’s lease of the Old Post Office (D.C. hotel) – making Trump effectively **landlord and tenant of a federal property** ([Trump Received 'Preferential Treatment' on Loan From Deutsche Bank: House Oversight - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-received-preferential-treatment-on-loan-from-deutsche-bank-house-oversight-2021-10#:~:text=requesting%20additional%20information)) ([Trump Received 'Preferential Treatment' on Loan From Deutsche Bank: House Oversight - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-received-preferential-treatment-on-loan-from-deutsche-bank-house-oversight-2021-10#:~:text=,the%20letter%20stated)). A GSA Inspector General report in 2019 noted this conflict, but the GSA under Trump took the position that it wasn’t their role to enforce the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause. By keeping ownership, Trump had **knowledge of which customers or partners were paying him while he made policy decisions**.

- **Frequent Use of Trump Properties for Government Business:** Trump blatantly **leveraged his office to promote his properties**. He traveled to or stayed at Trump-branded properties **547 days out of his 1,461 days as President (nearly 37% of the time) ([The Secret Service spent nearly $2 million at Trump properties - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/the-secret-service-spent-nearly-2-million-at-trump-properties/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20biggest%20sources,dollars%20of%20Secret%20Service%20spending)) ([The Secret Service spent nearly $2 million at Trump properties - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/the-secret-service-spent-nearly-2-million-at-trump-properties/#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D))**. For example, he often spent weekends at **Mar-a-Lago (Florida)** or **Trump National Golf Club Bedminster (NJ)**, which became known as the “Winter White House” and “Summer White House” respectively. Foreign dignitaries and cabinet meetings were hosted at Mar-a-Lago, showcasing it on the world stage. Each visit meant an entourage of government officials, Secret Service, and often foreign guests **pouring money into Trump’s business** for lodging, catering, etc. The **Secret Service alone spent nearly $2 million at Trump properties** during his term, essentially **paying Trump’s companies for the right to protect him** ([The Secret Service spent nearly $2 million at Trump properties - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/the-secret-service-spent-nearly-2-million-at-trump-properties/#:~:text=The%20Secret%20Service%20has%20spent,total%20closer%20to%20%242%20million)). Newly obtained records analyzed by CREW (a watchdog group) showed at least $1.75 million in documented Secret Service payments to Trump hotels and clubs (with the true total likely higher) ([The Secret Service spent nearly $2 million at Trump properties - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/the-secret-service-spent-nearly-2-million-at-trump-properties/#:~:text=The%20Secret%20Service%20has%20spent,total%20closer%20to%20%242%20million)) ([The Secret Service spent nearly $2 million at Trump properties - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/the-secret-service-spent-nearly-2-million-at-trump-properties/#:~:text=Newly%20acquired%20records%20show%20roughly,total%20closer%20to%20%242%20million)). In one infamous example, **Trump’s D.C. hotel charged the Secret Service $650 per night for rooms** during one of Eric Trump’s trips ([House panel: Trump's bills to Secret Service 'exorbitant' - AP News](https://apnews.com/article/travel-business-donald-trump-carolyn-maloney-137ff64160fa894ac8c0821bb5f0e7f8#:~:text=News%20apnews,rates%20at%20least%2040%20times)), far above government per diem rates. Similarly, at Mar-a-Lago, the Secret Service was billed $396/night per room and over $300,000 in total by 2018 ([The Secret Service spent nearly $2 million at Trump properties - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/the-secret-service-spent-nearly-2-million-at-trump-properties/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20biggest%20sources,in%20tens%20of%20thousands%20of)). All these taxpayer expenditures flowed **directly into Trump’s revenue**. Trump also directed official events to his properties. He hosted two international summits with Japan’s Prime Minister at Mar-a-Lago (2017 and 2018), and attempted to host the G7 summit at his struggling Doral resort in 2020. In a brazen announcement in October 2019, the White House said the G7 would be at Doral – which would have brought an enormous financial boon – only for Trump to backtrack after bipartisan backlash that this was a blatant conflict of interest and self-dealing. Even so, Trump’s message was clear: **the U.S. government was open for business at his businesses**.

- **Domestic Political Spending at Trump Businesses:** Trump’s political operation and the Republican Party became major customers of Trump properties, effectively converting donor money into Trump corporate revenue. The **Republican National Committee, Trump’s re-election campaign, and affiliated PACs spent millions at Trump-owned venues** for fundraisers, conventions, and events. For instance, during the first half of 2019 (the ramp-up to the election cycle), **78 Republican federal committees spent over $1.6 million at Trump hotels, golf clubs, and restaurants** ([Campaign Spending at Trump Properties Down, but Not Out — ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/campaign-spending-at-trump-properties-down-but-not-out#:~:text=During%20the%20first%20six%20months,half%20of%202019%2C%20filings%20show)) ([Campaign Spending at Trump Properties Down, but Not Out — ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/campaign-spending-at-trump-properties-down-but-not-out#:~:text=with%20the%20Republican%20National%20Committee,half%20of%202019%2C%20filings%20show)). Through the full 2020 campaign cycle, that number grew substantially – one tally (OpenSecrets) put total political spending at Trump properties at **$13 million from 2015 through late 2020**. This included big-ticket events like the RNC’s **$10 million 2020 convention contract** with Trump’s D.C. hotel (ultimately unused due to COVID), and countless smaller expenditures. Even after Trump left office, some GOP groups continued the practice: in the first six months of 2021, **27 Republican committees spent $348,000 at Trump properties** (though many others ceased once he was no longer in power) ([Campaign Spending at Trump Properties Down, but Not Out — ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/campaign-spending-at-trump-properties-down-but-not-out#:~:text=continuing%20to%20spend%3A%20a%20smaller,favor%20in%20contested%20Republican%20primaries)) ([Campaign Spending at Trump Properties Down, but Not Out — ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/campaign-spending-at-trump-properties-down-but-not-out#:~:text=During%20the%20first%20six%20months,half%20of%202019%2C%20filings%20show)). By channeling political events to his resorts (Mar-a-Lago became a frequent RNC donor retreat venue, and the Trump International Hotel in D.C. was a hub for GOP functions during 2017–2020), Trump **personally profited from his political position**. Campaign finance reports revealed expenditures such as **$1.1 million from Trump’s own campaign to Trump Tower for office rent**, and hundreds of thousands paid to Mar-a-Lago for ballroom rentals. While technically legal (campaigns can choose their venue), it was unprecedented for a president to so directly monetize his re-election effort.

- **Foreign Influence and Access at Properties:** As noted earlier, foreign governments patronizing Trump businesses raised conflict concerns under the Emoluments Clause. But even beyond the constitutional issue, it meant **foreign money lined Trump’s pockets while those governments sought favorable outcomes**. To illustrate, in 2018 the Saudi government, seeking to improve ties with the new administration, booked **500 nights at Trump’s D.C. hotel in a three-month span**, spending $190,000 (they were hosting U.S. veterans as part of a lobbying campaign) – Trump’s hotel staff noted the Saudis’ stays “helped us a lot” to reverse a business slump ([Trump Received 'Preferential Treatment' on Loan From Deutsche Bank: House Oversight - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-received-preferential-treatment-on-loan-from-deutsche-bank-house-oversight-2021-10#:~:text=Trump%27s%20refusal%20to%20divest%20himself,distance%20himself%20from%20his%20businesses)) ([Trump Received 'Preferential Treatment' on Loan From Deutsche Bank: House Oversight - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-received-preferential-treatment-on-loan-from-deutsche-bank-house-oversight-2021-10#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20Trump%20called%20the,accused%20him%20of%20violating%20it)). Kuwait’s embassy shifted its National Day party from the Four Seasons to Trump’s hotel after the election. China’s state-owned companies leased space in Trump Tower (one, the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, was Trump Tower’s largest office tenant, paying an estimated $1.9 million annual rent that continued through his term). These situations created at least the **appearance that Trump could be indirectly influenced by money flowing to him from abroad**. Ethics filings show that in 2017, Trump’s business earned **$145,400 in taxes/fees in India and $156,824 in the Philippines** – amounts exceeding what he paid the U.S. Treasury in income tax that year ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=During%20his%20first%20two%20years,income%20taxes)) ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=included%20%243%20million%20from%20the,income%20taxes)). Such statistics became talking points for critics alleging divided loyalties.

- **Government Contracts and Decisions Favoring Trump Ventures:** Besides events and patronage, Trump’s dual role raised questions whenever federal decisions intersected with his interests. A prominent example was the **military’s use of Trump’s Scottish resort**. In 2019, reports emerged that **U.S. Air Force crews on flights to the Middle East were routinely being routed to refuel at Prestwick Airport (near Trump Turnberry) and put up at Trump’s resort**, rather than at usual military bases in Europe ([Air Force crew made an odd stop on a routine trip: Trump's ... - Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/06/air-force-trump-scottish-retreat-1484337#:~:text=Politico%20www,they%20stayed%20at%20the)) ([Air Force says it sent crews to Trump's Scottish resort up to 40 times](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/12/air-force-trump-scottish-resort-1493624#:~:text=Air%20Force%20says%20it%20sent,far%20higher%20than%20previously%20known)). One Air Force crew in 2018 even got vouchers for **free rounds of golf at Turnberry** during a stay. The Air Force later admitted to around 40 refueling stopovers at Turnberry since 2017 – a sharp increase – though an internal review claimed the choice was within guidelines. Still, it looked like **U.S. defense dollars propped up Trump’s loss-making golf club**, and the House Oversight Committee began investigating this arrangement in 2019. Likewise, Vice President Mike **Pence oddly stayed at Trump’s resort in Doonbeg, Ireland** in Sept 2019, even though his meetings were in Dublin, requiring extra travel. Pence said he stayed there at Trump’s “suggestion” – again indicating Trump steering official business to his properties. Another case: in 2018, when **Trump’s failing hotel in Vancouver** (a franchise property) sought bankruptcy protection, the U.S. government’s position on Chinese investor visas – potentially affecting that property’s owners – came under question because the project had courted Chinese buyers. And in 2020, as COVID ravaged the hotel industry, some **Trump businesses sought pandemic relief**: Trump’s partner in Trump International Hotel & Tower Chicago did receive a **PPP loan between $2–5 million** to retain staff, and Trump’s DC hotel reportedly inquired with its lender (Deutsche Bank) for relief and was offered forbearance. Even the **U.S. Department of Justice, in 2020, intervened in Trump’s personal defamation lawsuit by E. Jean Carroll** (attempting to substitute the U.S. as defendant) – effectively using taxpayer-funded government lawyers to defend Trump in a private matter, arguably a misuse of office to protect him financially. 

The cumulative effect of these overlaps was stark. **Trump blurred the line between public service and private profit to an extent unseen in modern U.S. history.** According to a tally by CREW, by the end of his term Trump had amassed **3,403 conflicts of interest** related to his business holdings – including over 300 foreign officials visiting his properties and hundreds of political events at his venues. Trump’s response was defiance; he often said, “The presidency has cost me a fortune… this is a very hard thing to do. I don’t even take the salary.” However, while it’s possible his polarizing politics did reduce some business opportunities (as Forbes and others noted a decline in his net worth relative to projections), there is also strong evidence that **Trump used the presidency to **“line his pockets”**** ([The Secret Service spent nearly $2 million at Trump properties - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/the-secret-service-spent-nearly-2-million-at-trump-properties/#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)) ([The Secret Service spent nearly $2 million at Trump properties - CREW | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/the-secret-service-spent-nearly-2-million-at-trump-properties/#:~:text=match%20at%20L113%20from,began%20before%20his%20oath%20of)) – profiting from both U.S. government spending and private interests aiming to please him. House Oversight Chair Carolyn Maloney in 2021 summed up that **far from separating himself, Trump “effectively on both sides of the contract”** in many cases, and that his “**failing businesses**” received “**bailouts from President Trump’s other businesses**” and patrons seeking influence ([Trump Received 'Preferential Treatment' on Loan From Deutsche Bank: House Oversight - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-received-preferential-treatment-on-loan-from-deutsche-bank-house-oversight-2021-10#:~:text=,the%20letter%20stated)) ([Trump Received 'Preferential Treatment' on Loan From Deutsche Bank: House Oversight - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-received-preferential-treatment-on-loan-from-deutsche-bank-house-oversight-2021-10#:~:text=Collectively%2C%20the%20documents%20show%20,letter%20went%20on%20to%20say)).

These conflicts spurred calls for reform. By 2021, as Trump left office, there was momentum in Congress for tighter ethics laws (like banning presidents from contracting with the government, requiring disclosure of business clients, etc.). The **damage to government ethics was significant**, but Trump himself seemed to largely escape immediate consequences – the Emoluments suits ended without penalty, and voters, not courts, delivered the judgment by denying him re-election (some analysts believe Trump’s perceived self-dealing contributed to voter fatigue). Financially, however, the overlap provided **millions in revenue streams that likely kept some Trump businesses afloat** during tough times ([Trump Received 'Preferential Treatment' on Loan From Deutsche Bank: House Oversight - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-received-preferential-treatment-on-loan-from-deutsche-bank-house-oversight-2021-10#:~:text=million%20to%20aid%20the%20struggling,hotel)) ([Trump Received 'Preferential Treatment' on Loan From Deutsche Bank: House Oversight - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-received-preferential-treatment-on-loan-from-deutsche-bank-house-oversight-2021-10#:~:text=Collectively%2C%20the%20documents%20show%20,letter%20went%20on%20to%20say)). This dynamic of **political power fueling private profit** was perhaps the defining feature of Trump’s financial story in these years.

## Post-Presidency Business Moves (2021)

After leaving the White House on January 20, 2021, Donald Trump faced a new reality: he was free to actively engage in business again, but his brand carried the baggage of a tumultuous presidency and the January 6th Capitol riot. The year 2021 was thus a pivotal transition period for Trump’s finances. We look at **how Trump’s businesses adapted post-presidency**, the new ventures he launched, and the ongoing challenges and risks as of 2021:

- **Backlash and Loss of Certain Deals:** In the immediate aftermath of the Capitol riot, **Trump’s business relationships deteriorated sharply.** Several banks that had long served Trump (like Deutsche Bank and Signature Bank) formally **cut ties in early 2021**, pledging no new business with him ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=The%20Doral%20resort%20and%20Washington,Reuters%20on%20condition%20of%20anonymity)). Professional golf distanced itself: the **PGA of America voted on January 10, 2021 to cancel its 2022 Championship at Trump’s Bedminster course**, citing that associating with Trump would be detrimental to the PGA brand. This was a blow to Trump, who loves golf prestige; he called it a breach of contract and sued (the case was settled). **New York City moved to terminate Trump Organization contracts** to operate two ice rinks, a carousel, and the Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point (Bronx) – Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the city would no longer do business with Trump after Jan. 6. By February, NYC formally canceled those contracts ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=In%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20home%20base%20of,of%20the%20golf%20course%20lease)) ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=rebranded%20the%20Dominick%20in%202017,of%20the%20golf%20course%20lease)). The Trump Org fought back, filing a lawsuit over the golf course contract. Ultimately, NYC was able to replace Trump as operator of the ice rinks and carousel by late 2021, and by 2022 a settlement was reached to end the Ferry Point golf lease. These reprisals illustrated how **Trump’s actions in office (and especially the insurrection) directly harmed his business opportunities**. Even some long-time business partners sought exits – for instance, in early 2021, real estate giant Vornado reportedly explored buying out Trump’s 30% stake in 555 California and 1290 Avenue of the Americas (to dissociate from him), though Trump refused to sell at a discount ([Trump Judgment Puts Focus on His Stakes in Valuable New York ...](https://www.barrons.com/articles/trump-real-estate-vornado-value-0d1d58b0#:~:text=Trump%20Judgment%20Puts%20Focus%20on,The%20Wall)) ([Trump and Vornado Realty Trust to Receive $617 Million Windfall](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-vornado-realty-trust-windfall-financing-new-york-california-2021-5#:~:text=Trump%20and%20Vornado%20Realty%20Trust,property%20refinancing%20deal%2C%20reports%20say)). The cumulative effect was a **constriction of Trump’s business network**: fewer banks, no government contracts, and a tainted brand in many markets.

- **Financial Health in 2021:** Despite setbacks, Trump’s overall financial health in 2021 saw some stabilization. Forbes estimated Trump’s **net worth at about $2.5 billion in 2021** – roughly the same as it was in 2020, after a drop from an estimated $3.5 billion pre-presidency ([Wharton graduate Donald Trump drops off Forbes 400 list of richest people | The Daily Pennsylvanian](http://www.thedp.com/article/2021/10/trump-fell-short-of-forbes-400#:~:text=Although%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20net%20worth%20remains,71%20in%202003)) ([Wharton graduate Donald Trump drops off Forbes 400 list of richest people | The Daily Pennsylvanian](http://www.thedp.com/article/2021/10/trump-fell-short-of-forbes-400#:~:text=Although%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20net%20worth%20remains,71%20in%202003)). This stagnant net worth caused Trump to **fall off the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans for the first time in 25 years** (the cutoff in 2021 rose to $2.9 billion, and Trump missed it by ~$400 million) ([Wharton graduate Donald Trump drops off Forbes 400 list of richest people | The Daily Pennsylvanian](http://www.thedp.com/article/2021/10/trump-fell-short-of-forbes-400#:~:text=Although%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20net%20worth%20remains,71%20in%202003)) ([Wharton graduate Donald Trump drops off Forbes 400 list of richest people | The Daily Pennsylvanian](http://www.thedp.com/article/2021/10/trump-fell-short-of-forbes-400#:~:text=)). Forbes attributed this to Trump’s lack of diversification and the hit that urban real estate values took during the pandemic ([Wharton graduate Donald Trump drops off Forbes 400 list of richest people | The Daily Pennsylvanian](http://www.thedp.com/article/2021/10/trump-fell-short-of-forbes-400#:~:text=)). Many of Trump’s trophy assets (office buildings, hotels in big cities) were worth less in 2021 than a few years prior, while asset classes like tech stocks and crypto (which Trump did not have) soared – *“had Trump divested and reinvested in a blind trust in 2017, he’d likely be considerably richer today,”* Forbes noted ([Wharton graduate Donald Trump drops off Forbes 400 list of richest people | The Daily Pennsylvanian](http://www.thedp.com/article/2021/10/trump-fell-short-of-forbes-400#:~:text=)). Even so, Trump’s businesses were not collapsing. There were signs of **recovery** in some sectors: Mar-a-Lago’s membership was reportedly up (a number of high-profile members who quit in 2017 were replaced by an influx of new members eager to rub shoulders with the ex-president). Resorts and hotels began to rebound as COVID restrictions eased in late 2021. Trump’s **Doral golf resort, while still below its peak, saw improved bookings** as the Miami area benefited from a pandemic real estate boom and a surge of events relocated from lockdown states. Trump Tower in NYC remained partly empty, but a few new leases were signed at lower rents, and in 2021 one high-profile tenant – Trump’s PAC – began paying rent (which critics say is a way to funnel donor money to him). Additionally, the **sale of the D.C. hotel lease was negotiated in 2021** for an eventual price of $375 million – a strong price that, once closed (in May 2022), effectively turned a profit of over $100 million for Trump’s company on paper and erased the property’s debt ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=Trump%20is%20now%20making%20a,than%20%2473%20million%20since%202016)) ([Insight: Trump's real-estate empire pays the price for poisonous politics | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-real-estate-empire-pays-price-poisonous-politics-2021-10-29/#:~:text=of%20%24500%20million,than%20%2473%20million%20since%202016)). These outcomes indicated that **Trump’s business empire, while tarnished, remained viable and could even command top dollar from certain investors** (in this case, a Miami-based investment group ready to rebrand the hotel). 

- **New Ventures – The Trump Media & Technology Group:** Arguably the biggest post-presidency business move for Trump was **entering the media and tech space**. In October 2021, Trump announced the launch of **Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG)**, with plans to create a new social media platform called “TRUTH Social” as a conservative alternative to Twitter and Facebook (which had banned him). To finance this, TMTG struck a merger deal with a special-purpose acquisition company (**SPAC**), **Digital World Acquisition Corp (DWAC)**. The news of the deal on Oct. 20, 2021, set off a frenzy on Wall Street: DWAC’s stock, initially $10, **soared as high as $94 in two days (an 840% jump)** amid meme-stock style trading ([SPAC backing Trump has surged more than 800%. That's sparking ...](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dwac-trump-spac-trading-surge/#:~:text=SPAC%20backing%20Trump%20has%20surged,At%20one%20point%20in)) ([Trump's social media deal ignites 350% gain in SPAC's shares | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/trump-strikes-spac-deal-new-social-media-platform-shares-soar-2021-10-21/#:~:text=Even%20so%2C%20shares%20of%20Miami,from%20%24321%20million%20on%20Wednesday)). It closed around $45, up 357% in one day ([Trump's social media deal ignites 350% gain in SPAC's shares | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/trump-strikes-spac-deal-new-social-media-platform-shares-soar-2021-10-21/#:~:text=Even%20so%2C%20shares%20of%20Miami,from%20%24321%20million%20on%20Wednesday)). This implied a **market capitalization well into the billions** for the prospective Trump media venture. At one point DWAC’s market cap topped **$2 billion** on pure speculation ([Market Cap Soars for Trump-Linked SPAC - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/dwac-spac-donald-trump-truth-social-media-shares-soar-2021-12#:~:text=acquisition%20company%2C%20soared%20this%20week,Exchange%20Commission%20and%20other%20regulators)) ([Market Cap Soars for Trump-Linked SPAC - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/dwac-spac-donald-trump-truth-social-media-shares-soar-2021-12#:~:text=The%20stock%20price%20of%20Digital,now%20stands%20around%20%242%20billion)), and Trump’s personal stake (he owned about 80% of TMTG per filings) was valued at several billion on paper – **potentially doubling his net worth overnight** if it held ([Donald Trump's net worth more than doubles in one day](https://www.forbes.com.au/news/billionaires/donald-trumps-net-worth-doubles-in-a-day/#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%27s%20net%20worth%20more,8%20billion%20and%20Donald)). This SPAC deal offered Trump a chance at a *financial comeback*: essentially monetizing his massive following. By December 2021, TMTG/DWAC announced they had secured **$1 billion in PIPE investments** (private funding to come in with the merger) ([Market Cap Soars for Trump-Linked SPAC - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/dwac-spac-donald-trump-truth-social-media-shares-soar-2021-12#:~:text=and%20accompanying%20app%20to%20serve,woke%20content)) ([Market Cap Soars for Trump-Linked SPAC - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/dwac-spac-donald-trump-truth-social-media-shares-soar-2021-12#:~:text=billion%20from%20investors%20for%20TRUTH,social)). However, the venture also attracted regulatory scrutiny – the SEC and FINRA opened investigations into possible insider trading or premature discussions between TMTG and DWAC (since SPACs aren’t supposed to have merger targets lined up beforehand) ([Market Cap Soars for Trump-Linked SPAC - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/dwac-spac-donald-trump-truth-social-media-shares-soar-2021-12#:~:text=,Exchange%20Commission%20and%20other%20regulators)) ([Market Cap Soars for Trump-Linked SPAC - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/dwac-spac-donald-trump-truth-social-media-shares-soar-2021-12#:~:text=Then%2C%20on%20Monday%2C%20it%20was,following%C2%A0the%20October%2020%20merger%20announcement)). As of the end of 2021, TRUTH Social had not yet launched (it would in February 2022), and the merger was pending. But the **creation of Trump’s new media company signaled a shift**: after years of relying on real estate, Trump was pivoting to a capital-light, potentially high-growth sector, using his celebrity and political base as the product. If successful, this could bring a **significant new revenue stream** and lessen his dependence on the debt-laden properties. 

- **Other Post-Presidency Moves:** Trump also began a series of paid speaking engagements and rallies. In December 2021, he embarked on the “History Tour,” a ticketed speaking tour in arenas with Bill O’Reilly. Tickets ranged up to VIP packages for thousands of dollars, and while attendance was mixed, Trump likely earned fees. He continued to hold his signature political rallies (now paid for by his PAC), which kept his brand in the spotlight and indirectly supported merchandise sales (Trump’s campaign/PAC sold MAGA gear, etc., that sometimes benefited Trump-friendly vendors). The Trump Organization, now run day-to-day by Eric Trump and CFO Allen Weisselberg’s successor (after Weisselberg was sidelined by the indictment), quietly **explored new real estate deals** in 2021, focusing on friendly territories. In one example, **reports surfaced that Trump was in talks to sell the rights to his name for a new hotel in Mississippi or Florida** targeted at his supporter demographic (an idea to launch a “Patriot Hotel” chain). Also, with the **real estate market running hot in 2021**, the Trump Org started selling individual properties or lots at some holdings (for instance, listing a beachfront mansion adjacent to Mar-a-Lago for $49 million, which sold to a Trump family trust in 2021). These moves suggest a **strategy to capitalize on assets and potentially redeploy capital** into ventures more aligned with Trump’s political brand.

- **Ongoing Legal and Financial Risks:** Even out of office, Trump carried significant **legal baggage** that could impact his finances beyond 2021. The Manhattan D.A. criminal case loomed, with prosecutors in 2021 reportedly examining whether to charge Trump himself (some grand jury testimony in late 2021 hinted at potential charges for false business records). That case could lead to fines or even asset seizures if penalties were imposed on the company (indeed, in 2022 the Trump Org was convicted and could face $1.6 million in fines – not huge for Trump, but the criminal conviction might scare off partners). The NY AG civil suit, likely filed in 2022, could seek to **recover large sums** and impose restrictions on Trump’s business operations in New York – potentially forcing divestment of NY properties or barring loans from banks that must avoid fraudulent borrowers. Trump was also a defendant in multiple civil suits related to the election and Jan. 6 (e.g., by Capitol Police officers and D.C. AG for inciting violence, by voting machine companies for defamation via allies, etc.). While those primarily raise reputational issues, any could result in financial damages if he’s found liable. On the tax front, in 2021 the *Trump v. Mazars* Supreme Court saga concluded with Congress (House Oversight Committee) not yet obtaining documents; however, behind closed doors the **House did get documents from Trump’s accounting firm Mazars via a settlement** and produced a report in late 2021 showing that foreign government spending (e.g. at D.C. hotel) was more than previously known ([Trump Received 'Preferential Treatment' on Loan From Deutsche Bank: House Oversight - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-received-preferential-treatment-on-loan-from-deutsche-bank-house-oversight-2021-10#:~:text=,the%20committee%20said)). Additionally, it emerged that the **General Services Administration had allowed Trump to defer payments on the D.C. hotel’s lease during COVID** – effectively a slight government financial accommodation to him (he paid a portion a bit late in 2020), which Congressional overseers criticized. All told, Trump left office with numerous investigations **still in progress**. These pose both financial risk (fines, back taxes) and constraints on future business (banks may remain wary, partners might include compliance escape clauses). 

Looking ahead from the vantage point of end-2021, **Trump’s financial trajectory appeared to hinge on a few factors**: (1) his ability to convert fervent political support into profitable enterprises (like Truth Social, or even a possible 2024 campaign that could spur fundraising he might find ways to tap into indirectly), (2) the performance and refinancing of his core real estate assets in a (hopefully) post-pandemic economy, and (3) the outcome of legal actions that could either saddle him with big payouts or, conversely, remove lingering uncertainties (for example, if the IRS audit ended in his favor). There was also speculation that Trump might run for president again in 2024 – a move that would impact his businesses (could bring another wave of divestment calls and conflict issues). Notably, Trump had about **$430 million of debts coming due between 2022 and 2024** ([President Donald Trump paid $750 in U.S. income taxes in 2016, 2017, newspaper report says | The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/news/president-donald-trump-paid-750-in-u-s-income-taxes-in-2016-2017-newspaper-report-says/#:~:text=each%20in%202016%20and%202017)), which he would need to address, but **he had amassed a reported $122 million war chest in his political PAC by end of 2021**, which, while not legally his to spend freely, gave him the clout and resources to maintain influence.

In conclusion, by the end of 2021 **Donald Trump’s financial empire remained intact but under pressure**. He navigated the 2018–2021 period through a mix of leveraging the presidency, aggressive legal resistance, and timely financial maneuvers. The result was a business portfolio that survived a presidency – something many doubted at the start – albeit somewhat shrunken in relative wealth and facing ongoing clouds of legal uncertainty. Trump’s post-presidency moves demonstrated his trademark approach: **turning setbacks into new opportunities** (e.g., a social media platform born from his Twitter ban) and utilizing his fame and loyal base as economic assets. How successful these efforts will be in the long run remains to be fully seen, but as of 2021, Trump had set the stage for the next chapter of his financial saga, armed with both the **lessons and liabilities** of the extraordinary 2018–2021 period.
