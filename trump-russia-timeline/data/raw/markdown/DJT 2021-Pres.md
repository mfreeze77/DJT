I will conduct a thorough scholarly analysis covering Trump's Russian connections from 2021 to March 3, 2025, maintaining the same chronological and thematic structure as the previous research. This research will examine Trump's post-presidency business dealings, political statements, legal cases, and any ongoing Russian ties, with a focus on intelligence assessments, financial entanglements, and foreign policy implications.

The research will prioritize primary sources such as government documents, court filings, and intelligence reports, supplemented by credible journalistic investigations and expert analyses. I will also include comparative analysis to assess whether Trump's post-presidency Russia connections deviate from historical norms.

I will update you once the research is compiled and ready for review.

**Post-Presidency Business Dealings (2021–2025).** After leaving office, Donald Trump’s business empire continued to attract scrutiny for ties to Russian money, though few new ventures in Russia materialized. The Trump Organization did not announce major new projects in Russia after 2021, reflecting both geopolitical tensions and ongoing investigations. Trump has maintained that he “owns nothing in Russia” and has “no deals in Russia,” but past dealings cast a long shadow ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=MIAMI%2FMOSCOW%20%E2%80%93%20During%20the%202016,has%20been%20even%20more%20emphatic)). Reports show that even before 2016, wealthy Russians invested heavily in Trump-branded properties abroad, especially in South Florida, buying at least $98 million worth of Trump condos – a pattern raising concerns about potential money laundering ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida)) ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=But%20in%20the%20United%20States%2C,documents%2C%20interviews%20and%20corporate%20records)). Post-presidency, those concerns persisted. Financial crime experts note that luxury U.S. real estate has long been a vehicle for offshore wealth, and Trump’s properties – from New York to Florida – have drawn a disproportionate share of Russian buyers, some with political connections ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=documents%2C%20interviews%20and%20corporate%20records)). While no legal action has specifically charged the Trump Organization with laundering Russian funds, the sheer volume of opaque purchases by shell companies linked to Russia has been widely cited by journalists and lawmakers as a red flag warranting continued scrutiny ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=The%20Reuters%20review%20of%20investors,be%20from%20Putin%E2%80%99s%20inner%20circle)). These transactions, though not illegal per se, fit a broader pattern of Russian capital seeking safe haven in Western assets – with Trump’s brand often a beneficiary, intentionally or not. Law enforcement agencies like the FBI and FinCEN have since 2016 tightened monitoring of high-end real estate transactions to detect illicit flows, underscoring why Trump’s foreign clientele draws ongoing attention (even if he was not directly implicated) ([Blunting Foreign Interference Efforts by Learning the Lessons of the Past - Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/blunting-foreign-interference-efforts-learning-lessons-past/#:~:text=checkered%20history%20of%20business%20in,%E2%80%9D%20118)) ([Blunting Foreign Interference Efforts by Learning the Lessons of the Past - Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/blunting-foreign-interference-efforts-learning-lessons-past/#:~:text=It%20remains%20unknown%20why%20the,Mueller%20fired%20in%20the%20immediate)). In short, Trump’s post-White House business dealings show no new Moscow hotels or towers, but the legacy of past Russian investments in his properties continues to fuel questions about hidden financial entanglements.

Financial relationships formed before 2021 also entered a new phase. **Deutsche Bank**, Trump’s primary lender for decades (providing an estimated $2+ billion in loans over time), moved decisively to distance itself. In January 2021 – days after the Capitol riot – Deutsche Bank announced it **would no longer do business with Trump** or his company ([Deutsche Bank cuts ties with Trump after Capitol attack - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/12/deutsche-bank-cuts-ties-trump-458193#:~:text=Deutsche%20Bank%2C%20one%20of%20President,finances%20once%20he%20leaves%20office)). At that time Trump still owed the bank over $300 million across several loans ([Deutsche Bank cuts ties with Trump after Capitol attack - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/12/deutsche-bank-cuts-ties-trump-458193#:~:text=itself%20from%20its%20best,finances%20once%20he%20leaves%20office)). This severance ended one of the most enigmatic bank-client relationships in modern finance. Deutsche Bank had been virtually alone among major banks in continuing to lend to Trump after a string of 1990s bankruptcies, a relationship that later drew scrutiny for potential **Russian connections**. Congressional investigators noted that Deutsche Bank not only lent to Trump when others wouldn’t, but also had a “checkered history” in the former Soviet Union, including large fines for Russian money-laundering schemes ([Blunting Foreign Interference Efforts by Learning the Lessons of the Past - Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/blunting-foreign-interference-efforts-learning-lessons-past/#:~:text=longtime%20partnership%20with%20the%20German,risks%20and%20outside%20scrutiny%2C%20and)). Notably, **Deutsche Bank’s private wealth division even introduced Trump to wealthy Russians interested in investing in Western real estate** ([Blunting Foreign Interference Efforts by Learning the Lessons of the Past - Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/blunting-foreign-interference-efforts-learning-lessons-past/#:~:text=author%20of%20Dark%20Towers%3A%20Deutsche,%E2%80%9D59)). These past revelations fed speculation that Russian-linked funds might have indirectly supported Trump’s ventures via Deutsche Bank’s lending or referrals. However, after 2021, Deutsche Bank’s disengagement left Trump’s business needing new financing. In 2022, Trump **refinanced or paid off much of his Deutsche Bank debt**: for example, he obtained a $100 million loan from Axos Bank (a smaller U.S. lender) against Trump Tower and another loan to replace Deutsche Bank’s mortgage on his Doral resort ([When Trump needs cash, a California bank and one of its top ...](https://apnews.com/article/trump-axos-bank-don-hankey-loans-ethics-37846dca8056962bee4973105e51e045#:~:text=When%20Trump%20needs%20cash%2C%20a,just%20as%20they%20were)). By mid-2022, Trump had effectively **zeroed out hundreds of millions in Deutsche Bank debt**, either through refinancing or asset sales (such as the $375 million sale of his Washington D.C. hotel lease) ([Trump's Secret, Ugly Breakup With Deutsche Bank Revealed](https://www.businessinsider.com/trumps-secret-ugly-breakup-with-deutsche-bank-revealed-2022-10#:~:text=Revealed%20www,hundreds%20of%20millions%20in%20debt)). These maneuvers meant that any direct financial leverage Deutsche Bank – or by extension, its regulators investigating Russian money flows – had over Trump was largely eliminated by the end of 2022. Still, Congressional committees (House Financial Services and Intelligence) fought to obtain Trump’s Deutsche Bank records for insight into **foreign financing risks**, and court battles over those records continued into 2021 ([

The House inquiry, led by Rep. Adam Schiff, emphasized unresolved “counterintelligence risks” from Trump’s foreign financial ties, implicitly including Russia ([Schiff says FBI hasn't probed national security risks of Trump's foreign financial ties - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/26/adam-schiff-fbi-trump-foreign-financial-ties-402318#:~:text=The%20FBI%E2%80%99s%20counterintelligence%20division%20does,a%20newly%20released%20legal%20analysis)) ([Schiff says FBI hasn't probed national security risks of Trump's foreign financial ties - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/26/adam-schiff-fbi-trump-foreign-financial-ties-402318#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBased%20on%20the%20Committee%E2%80%99s%20review%2C,about%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20foreign%20financial%20entanglements)). Ultimately, while Trump’s post-presidency business did not forge new Russian deals, **financial threads connecting him to Russian-linked capital persisted** through debt, real estate purchases, and opaque investments – all of which remained under the microscope of journalists and investigators, though without any formal allegations of wrongdoing by Trump **so far** ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=The%20Reuters%20review%20of%20investors,be%20from%20Putin%E2%80%99s%20inner%20circle)).

One notable post-presidency development was the infusion of **Russian-connected funds into Trump’s new media venture**. In early 2022, as Trump’s social media startup (Trump Media & Technology Group, behind the Truth Social platform) struggled financially, it received a pair of emergency loans totaling $8 million from a mysteriously structured entity called the ES Family Trust ([Trump’s Truth Social media company ‘propped up in 2022 by Russian-American under criminal investigation’ | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-truth-social-emergency-loans-b2522794.html#:~:text=That%20expense%20forced%20the%20company,in%20Dominica%20in%20the%20Caribbean)). An investigation by *The Guardian* later revealed leaked documents showing this money came from a **Dominica-registered bank with Russian ownership** ([Trump’s Truth Social media company ‘propped up in 2022 by Russian-American under criminal investigation’ | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-truth-social-emergency-loans-b2522794.html#:~:text=promissory%20notes%20,in%20Dominica%20in%20the%20Caribbean)) ([Trump’s Truth Social media company ‘propped up in 2022 by Russian-American under criminal investigation’ | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-truth-social-emergency-loans-b2522794.html#:~:text=The%20broadsheet%20cites%20leaked%20documents,role%20in%20the%20TMTG%20merger)). Specifically, the loans were traced to an account opened with Paxum Bank by the ES Family Trust, which is linked to **Anton Postolnikov**, a Russian-American financier. Postolnikov – a co-owner of Paxum Bank – is reportedly the **grandson of a prominent Kremlin official** and himself became a subject of FBI and Treasury investigations for **money laundering and insider trading** in relation to the Truth Social deal ([Trump’s Truth Social media company ‘propped up in 2022 by Russian-American under criminal investigation’ | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-truth-social-emergency-loans-b2522794.html#:~:text=The%20broadsheet%20cites%20leaked%20documents,role%20in%20the%20TMTG%20merger)) ([Trump’s Truth Social media company ‘propped up in 2022 by Russian-American under criminal investigation’ | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-truth-social-emergency-loans-b2522794.html#:~:text=Mr%20Postolnikov%20has%20not%20been,defendants%20pleaded%20guilty)). In other words, Trump’s fledgling media company was **propped up with $8 million from an individual tied to Russia**, at a time when U.S. regulators had frozen other funding pending an SEC inquiry. The **Russian-linked lifeline** kept Trump’s Truth Social afloat into its 2023 stock market debut ([Trump’s Truth Social media company ‘propped up in 2022 by Russian-American under criminal investigation’ | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-truth-social-emergency-loans-b2522794.html#:~:text=According%20to%20The%20Guardian%2C%20TMTG,make%20its%20stock%20market%20bow)) ([Trump’s Truth Social media company ‘propped up in 2022 by Russian-American under criminal investigation’ | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-truth-social-emergency-loans-b2522794.html#:~:text=Paxum%20Bank%20does%20not%20have,could%20not%20furnish%20the%20loan%E2%80%9D)). Importantly, there is no evidence Trump or his executives knew the provenance of these funds; the transactions were routed through offshore entities, and no charges have been filed against Trump Media. Nonetheless, the revelation raised eyebrows in Congress and among experts. Democrats in the Senate and House called for inquiries into whether foreign (potentially Russian) money infiltrated Trump’s business via this deal ([Trump Media deal faces calls for inquiry over alleged 'influence ...](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/04/trump-media-stock-russia-links#:~:text=Trump%20Media%20deal%20faces%20calls,American)). The incident illustrates how **Russian-associated finance found its way into Trump’s post-presidential projects**, even as he remained out of power. Combined with longstanding allegations (never proven) that some Trump real estate deals functioned as conduits for Russian oligarch wealth, such episodes have kept questions alive about Trump’s vulnerability to foreign capital and influence. In summary, while Trump’s **business ties to Russia from 2021–2025** were less about new deals and more about **unwinding old financial relationships**, significant concerns endured regarding Russian money in his enterprises – from condo buyers and secretive loans to the unresolved mysteries of how his pre-2016 ventures were financed. These concerns have not resulted in legal action post-2021, but they form a crucial backdrop for evaluating Trump’s public posture toward Moscow in this period.

**Political and Public Statements on Russia (2021–2025).** In his post-presidency years, Donald Trump’s rhetoric about Russia and Vladimir Putin remained strikingly sympathetic, even as Russia launched a major war in Europe. Trump often **lavished praise on Putin**, doubling down on the favorable tone he struck while in office. Notably, as Russia prepared to invade Ukraine in early 2022, Trump hailed Putin’s strategy in astonishing terms. In a February 2022 radio interview, Trump called Putin’s moves “*genius*” and “*very savvy*” for declaring parts of eastern Ukraine “independent” as a pretext for invasion ([Trump praises 'genius' Putin for moving troops to eastern Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/23/trump-putin-genius-russia-ukraine-crisis#:~:text=Trump%20praises%20%27genius%27%20Putin%20for,eastern%20Ukraine%20as%20independent%20states)). This remark – effectively praising Putin’s brinkmanship – drew bipartisan criticism in the United States. Even some Republicans were irked that a former U.S. president was complimenting Putin’s aggression ([Trump condemns Russia invasion; hints again at 2024 presidential run | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-condemns-russia-invasion-says-he-prays-ukrainian-people-2022-02-27/#:~:text=Trump%20had%20irked%20some%20Republican,pretty%20savvy)). Days later, when Russian forces poured into Ukraine, Trump attempted to recalibrate his tone, but continued to send mixed messages. Speaking at the CPAC conference on February 26, 2022, he **condemned the invasion** as “appalling” and voiced prayers for the Ukrainian people ([Trump condemns Russia invasion; hints again at 2024 presidential run | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-condemns-russia-invasion-says-he-prays-ukrainian-people-2022-02-27/#:~:text=ORLANDO%2C%20Fla,Vladimir%20Putin%20earlier%20this%20week)) ([Trump condemns Russia invasion; hints again at 2024 presidential run | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-condemns-russia-invasion-says-he-prays-ukrainian-people-2022-02-27/#:~:text=Trump%20expressed%20empathy%20for%20Ukrainians,stays%20in%20Kyiv%2C%20the%20capital)). Yet in the same speech, Trump boasted that Putin would never have dared invade if Trump were still president – blaming President Biden’s “weakness” and even referencing Trump’s own false claims about the 2020 U.S. election as the supposed cause of the war ([Trump condemns Russia invasion; hints again at 2024 presidential run | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-condemns-russia-invasion-says-he-prays-ukrainian-people-2022-02-27/#:~:text=Trump%20said%20that%20Putin%20took,to%20blame%20for%20Biden%27s%20victory)). He claimed the Ukraine war was “a horrific disaster” that **“would never have happened”** but for Biden’s presidency, implicitly crediting his personal toughness or rapport with Putin for four years of relative calm ([Trump condemns Russia invasion; hints again at 2024 presidential run | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-condemns-russia-invasion-says-he-prays-ukrainian-people-2022-02-27/#:~:text=of%20his%2C%20again%20falsely%20saying,to%20blame%20for%20Biden%27s%20victory)). Throughout 2022 and 2023, Trump threaded this needle: **expressing admiration for Putin’s cunning while vaguely lamenting the war’s human costs**. For example, he praised Ukrainian President Zelenskyy’s bravery under fire, but just as readily called Putin “smart” for how he handled the confrontation ([Trump condemns Russia invasion; hints again at 2024 presidential run | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-condemns-russia-invasion-says-he-prays-ukrainian-people-2022-02-27/#:~:text=Trump%20had%20irked%20some%20Republican,pretty%20savvy)) ([Trump condemns Russia invasion; hints again at 2024 presidential run | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-condemns-russia-invasion-says-he-prays-ukrainian-people-2022-02-27/#:~:text=Trump%20expressed%20empathy%20for%20Ukrainians,stays%20in%20Kyiv%2C%20the%20capital)). This ambivalence – refusing to cast Putin as an outright villain – starkly contrasted with traditional American political rhetoric, especially as evidence of Russian atrocities in Ukraine mounted. Trump avoided condemning Putin personally; instead, he often praised Putin’s leadership qualities (strength, intelligence) even as he nominally opposed the invasion in principle.

Trump’s commentary on the **Russia-Ukraine war** consistently returned to a self-aggrandizing theme: that **he alone could have prevented or quickly end the conflict**. In multiple interviews and rallies through 2023 and into 2024, Trump claimed that if he were president, he would broker peace in “24 hours.” At a CNN town hall in May 2023, he pointedly refused to say he wanted Ukraine to win, instead stating, *“I want everybody to stop dying. They’re dying, Russians and Ukrainians. I want them to stop dying. And I’ll have that done – I’ll have that done in 24 hours”* ([Trump says he can end the Russia-Ukraine war in one ... - AP News](https://apnews.com/article/trump-russia-ukraine-war-un-election-a78ecb843af452b8dda1d52d137ca893#:~:text=News%20apnews,that%20done%20%E2%80%94%20I)) ([Trump tells CNN town hall: 'I want everyone to stop dying' in Ukraine](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2023/05/11/trump-tells-cnn-town-hall-i-want-everyone-to-stop-dying-in-ukraine/#:~:text=Ukraine%20responsiblestatecraft.org%20%20The%20Republican,the%20war%20%27in%2024%20hours)). Such statements signaled that Trump envisioned a negotiated settlement amenable to Moscow. He suggested he would **meet with Putin and Zelenskyy and strike a deal quickly** ([Trump tells CNN town hall: 'I want everyone to stop dying' in Ukraine](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2023/05/11/trump-tells-cnn-town-hall-i-want-everyone-to-stop-dying-in-ukraine/#:~:text=Ukraine%20responsiblestatecraft.org%20%20The%20Republican,the%20war%20%27in%2024%20hours)), without specifying terms – raising concerns he might pressure Ukraine to cede territory for peace. When pressed, Trump did not deviate from praising Putin’s acumen; he called Putin *“a very smart guy”* and blamed Biden for not effectively deterring the Kremlin ([Trump Speaks at CPAC 2023 Transcript](https://www.rev.com/transcripts/trump-speaks-at-cpac-2023-transcript#:~:text=match%20at%20L864%20cities,cute%3F%20You%20know%20what%20amazed)). Indeed, Trump took credit for the fact that “Russia never took over a country during my term,” recounting how he supposedly warned Putin against aggression by saying “*don’t do it… or Moscow will be hit very hard*,” a claim that mixes bravado with admiration ([Trump Speaks at CPAC 2023 Transcript](https://www.rev.com/transcripts/trump-speaks-at-cpac-2023-transcript#:~:text=was%20also%20the%20only%20president,Well%2C%20I%20told%20him%20things)) ([Trump Speaks at CPAC 2023 Transcript](https://www.rev.com/transcripts/trump-speaks-at-cpac-2023-transcript#:~:text=match%20at%20L864%20cities,cute%3F%20You%20know%20what%20amazed)). In Trump’s narrative, his personal relationship with Putin – “*we were friends*,” as he has put it – was key to restraining Russian expansion ([Trump Speaks at CPAC 2023 Transcript](https://www.rev.com/transcripts/trump-speaks-at-cpac-2023-transcript#:~:text=was%20also%20the%20only%20president,Well%2C%20I%20told%20him%20things)). This framing implicitly **absolves Putin of primary blame** and instead faults U.S. leadership changes. Even as Russian missiles rained on Ukrainian cities, Trump’s commentary often sounded like *both-sides* equivocation. He emphasized the war’s cost to **“both Russians and Ukrainians”** and stressed the need for a deal, rather than unequivocally siding with Ukraine’s defense of its sovereignty ([Trump says he can end the Russia-Ukraine war in one ... - AP News](https://apnews.com/article/trump-russia-ukraine-war-un-election-a78ecb843af452b8dda1d52d137ca893#:~:text=News%20apnews,that%20done%20%E2%80%94%20I)) ([Trump tells CNN town hall: 'I want everyone to stop dying' in Ukraine](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2023/05/11/trump-tells-cnn-town-hall-i-want-everyone-to-stop-dying-in-ukraine/#:~:text=Ukraine%20responsiblestatecraft.org%20%20The%20Republican,the%20war%20%27in%2024%20hours)). Such rhetoric aligned with Kremlin talking points that portray Russia as forced into the conflict and eager for negotiations on its terms.

Beyond Ukraine, Trump continued his longstanding **skepticism of NATO and U.S. alliances**, positions that delighted Moscow. He persistently criticized NATO allies as freeloaders and hinted the U.S. might not honor its mutual defense commitments if allies didn’t pay more. For instance, in a 2023 speech, Trump proudly recounted telling NATO partners behind closed doors: *“If we get attacked by Russia, I will not protect you – unless you pay up.”* ([Trump Speaks at CPAC 2023 Transcript](https://www.rev.com/transcripts/trump-speaks-at-cpac-2023-transcript#:~:text=match%20at%20L766%20and%20if,overnight%20mail%2C%20sir%2C%20I%20promise)). By Trump’s account, this tough talk spurred allies to increase defense spending ([Trump Speaks at CPAC 2023 Transcript](https://www.rev.com/transcripts/trump-speaks-at-cpac-2023-transcript#:~:text=and%20if%20we%20get%20attacked,overnight%20mail%2C%20sir%2C%20I%20promise)). However, such rhetoric – effectively **threatening to abandon NATO obligations** – was unprecedented for a former (or aspiring) U.S. president. It alarmed European officials and contradicted decades of Republican hawkishness toward Russia. Trump also argued that under Biden, NATO had grown “too lenient,” and even blamed Biden for “forcing” Russia and China into a closer partnership ([Trump Speaks at CPAC 2023 Transcript](https://www.rev.com/transcripts/trump-speaks-at-cpac-2023-transcript#:~:text=match%20at%20L839%20never%20allow,And%20you%20can%20add)) ([Trump Speaks at CPAC 2023 Transcript](https://www.rev.com/transcripts/trump-speaks-at-cpac-2023-transcript#:~:text=never%20allow%20Russia%20and%20China,And%20you%20can%20add)). In multiple appearances, Trump asserted that under his leadership, **Russia would not be driving closer to China**, and he lambasted Biden for “making them bosom buddies” ([Trump Speaks at CPAC 2023 Transcript](https://www.rev.com/transcripts/trump-speaks-at-cpac-2023-transcript#:~:text=match%20at%20L839%20never%20allow,And%20you%20can%20add)). The irony of these statements was not lost on observers: Trump was simultaneously claiming he’d be tougher on Russia’s geopolitical alignment *and* more accommodating to Putin’s demands. In effect, Trump signaled a **foreign policy shift** in the Republican stance – from Reagan’s hard line to an “America First” realignment that downgrades confronting Russia. He even mused about **leaving NATO** during his presidency and did nothing to dispel speculation he might withdraw the U.S. from NATO in a second term ([Could NATO survive a second Trump administration?](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/could-nato-survive-a-second-trump-administration/#:~:text=Could%20NATO%20survive%20a%20second,National%20Defense%20Authorization%20Act)) ([Could NATO survive a second Trump administration?](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/could-nato-survive-a-second-trump-administration/#:~:text=Bolton%20has%20flatly%20predicted%3A%20%E2%80%9CIn,National%20Defense%20Authorization%20Act)). Trump’s NATO-bashing and admiration for Putin’s leadership became standard fare in his rallies, often to applause from his base, which had absorbed his narrative that NATO allies “rip us off” and that Putin, while “bad,” at least was “smart” and could be reasoned with. This position – **critical of traditional U.S. alliances and soft on the Kremlin** – represented a remarkable realignment of GOP rhetoric, one that Putin himself noted with satisfaction.

When it came to the issue of **Russian election interference**, Trump remained in deep denial. He consistently dismissed the well-documented findings of U.S. intelligence agencies about Kremlin meddling in 2016 and 2020, branding them the “Russia hoax.” Even out of office, Trump attacked the *“Russia, Russia, Russia”* investigation as a politically motivated witch hunt ([Trump Speaks at CPAC 2023 Transcript](https://www.rev.com/transcripts/trump-speaks-at-cpac-2023-transcript#:~:text=But%20they%E2%80%99re%20so%20bad%2C%20so,The)). In a 2023 CPAC speech, he boasted that after years of scrutiny, investigators *“checked millions of calls… not one call to Russia”* from his offices, and thus it was all a sham ([Trump Speaks at CPAC 2023 Transcript](https://www.rev.com/transcripts/trump-speaks-at-cpac-2023-transcript#:~:text=match%20at%20L573%20this%20is,but%20some%20people%20were%20surprised)). (In reality, the Mueller investigation documented extensive contacts between Trump associates and Russians ([Trump Speaks at CPAC 2023 Transcript](https://www.rev.com/transcripts/trump-speaks-at-cpac-2023-transcript#:~:text=prison%20for%20what%20he%20has,they%20all%20admit%20it%20was)), but Trump continued to cherry-pick claims of “no collusion.”) He singled out former officials like FBI agent Peter Strzok and Rep. Adam Schiff for scorn, accusing them of fabricating a conspiracy ([Trump Speaks at CPAC 2023 Transcript](https://www.rev.com/transcripts/trump-speaks-at-cpac-2023-transcript#:~:text=But%20they%E2%80%99re%20so%20bad%2C%20so,The)) ([Trump Speaks at CPAC 2023 Transcript](https://www.rev.com/transcripts/trump-speaks-at-cpac-2023-transcript#:~:text=prison%20for%20what%20he%20has,they%20all%20admit%20it%20was)). This relentless messaging – that the Russia investigation was **“fake news”** and that *“they know it’s a hoax”* ([Trump Speaks at CPAC 2023 Transcript](https://www.rev.com/transcripts/trump-speaks-at-cpac-2023-transcript#:~:text=But%20they%E2%80%99re%20so%20bad%2C%20so,The)) – served two purposes. First, it shored up Trump’s political base by portraying him as a victim of a Deep State plot. Second, it laid the groundwork for dismissing any future reports of Russian interference in the 2024 election. Indeed, going into 2024, Trump showed **little interest in acknowledging or countering ongoing Russian influence efforts**. When U.S. officials warned of active Russian disinformation campaigns (for example, a Kremlin-backed fake video in 2024 falsely depicting ballot fraud in Georgia ([Joint ODNI, FBI, and CISA Statement on Russian Election Influence Efforts — FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/joint-odni-fbi-and-cisa-statement-on-russian-election-influence-efforts#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20IC%20assesses%20that%20Russian,the%20video%E2%80%99s%20claims%20as%20false))), Trump either ignored the warnings or accused the intelligence community of targeting him again. Publicly, he maintained that **China, not Russia, was the bigger meddling threat** (a claim unsupported by intel assessments) and that the biggest “interference” in U.S. elections was actually the domestic “fraud” he baselessly alleges cost him victory in 2020. In sum, Trump’s post-presidential statements on Russia followed a clear pattern: **praise Putin, pillory NATO, and deny any Russian wrongdoing in U.S. politics**. This unwavering rhetoric had real-world implications, emboldening pro-Russian elements and worrying U.S. allies, as detailed below.

**Legal Cases and Investigations (2021–2025).** Even after Trump left office, various investigations touched on his Russian connections – some directly, others tangentially – though **no new criminal charges emerged relating to Russia**. A major development was the conclusion of Special Counsel **John Durham’s investigation** into the origins of the FBI’s 2016 “Crossfire Hurricane” probe. Durham, appointed during the Trump administration, released his final report in May 2023. His findings were politically charged: Durham criticized the FBI for **“failing to uphold… fidelity to the law”** in the Russia inquiry ([Graham Statement on the Durham Report | United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/graham-statement-on-the-durham-report#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)). He noted that at the start of the investigation in 2016, *“neither U.S. law enforcement nor the Intelligence Community appears to have possessed any actual evidence of collusion”* between the Trump campaign and Russia ([Graham Statement on the Durham Report | United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/graham-statement-on-the-durham-report#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)). He also highlighted that the infamous Steele dossier’s allegations could not be corroborated ([Graham Statement on the Durham Report | United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/graham-statement-on-the-durham-report#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)). In essence, the Durham Report argued the FBI rushed to investigate Trump based on sketchy information and confirmation bias. **Trump seized on Durham’s report as vindication**, loudly proclaiming that it proved the “Russia collusion hoax” was baseless and politically motivated. Indeed, Trump and his allies pointed to Durham’s findings – and the lack of new charges – to claim he’d been **exonerated** of any wrongdoing with Russia ([Graham Statement on the Durham Report | United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/graham-statement-on-the-durham-report#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWhat%20have%20we%20learned%20from,the%20mainstream%20media%20is%20dead)) ([Graham Statement on the Durham Report | United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/graham-statement-on-the-durham-report#:~:text=quickly%20hold%20a%20Senate%20Judiciary,fulfill%20the%20Committee%E2%80%99s%20oversight%20obligations)). However, it’s important to note what Durham did **not** do: he did *not* dispute the core intelligence conclusion that Russia interfered in 2016, nor did he offer an alternative explanation for the many contacts between Trump associates and Russians. His report focused on FBI missteps rather than Trump’s conduct. Critics observed that while Durham lambasted the investigation, he **uncovered no evidence to refute that Russia tried to help Trump win** – and no evidence implicating Trump in a criminal conspiracy beyond what Mueller reported. Nonetheless, the **political impact** was significant. Congressional Republicans held hearings to amplify Durham’s findings, further entrenching the partisan divide over the Russia issue. By 2024, in the GOP narrative, the “real” scandal was the FBI’s investigation itself, not Trump’s Russia ties – a striking reversal from just a few years prior ([Graham Statement on the Durham Report | United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/graham-statement-on-the-durham-report#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWhat%20have%20we%20learned%20from,the%20mainstream%20media%20is%20dead)) ([Graham Statement on the Durham Report | United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/graham-statement-on-the-durham-report#:~:text=quickly%20hold%20a%20Senate%20Judiciary,fulfill%20the%20Committee%E2%80%99s%20oversight%20obligations)). Legally, the Durham probe’s end marked the end of high-profile **Russia-related investigations** on U.S. soil, shifting focus to other Trump controversies (like his handling of classified documents and the Jan. 6 insurrection). 

Outside the Durham probe, **Congressional inquiries** into Trump’s foreign ties continued quietly until the Republicans took control of the House in January 2023. During 2021–2022, the Democratic-led House Intelligence Committee (under Chairman Adam Schiff) and House Financial Services Committee (under Chair Maxine Waters) pressed forward with long-running efforts to obtain Trump’s financial records from Deutsche Bank and other institutions ([

Their aim was to investigate “potential counterintelligence risks arising from President Trump’s foreign financial ties” ([

Schiff openly worried in mid-2020 (and reiterated afterward) that **the FBI had never thoroughly probed Trump’s finances for foreign leverage** ([Schiff says FBI hasn't probed national security risks of Trump's foreign financial ties - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/26/adam-schiff-fbi-trump-foreign-financial-ties-402318#:~:text=The%20FBI%E2%80%99s%20counterintelligence%20division%20does,a%20newly%20released%20legal%20analysis)) ([Schiff says FBI hasn't probed national security risks of Trump's foreign financial ties - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/26/adam-schiff-fbi-trump-foreign-financial-ties-402318#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBased%20on%20the%20Committee%E2%80%99s%20review%2C,about%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20foreign%20financial%20entanglements)). Indeed, in an August 2020 court filing, Schiff’s committee noted with alarm that *“the FBI Counterintelligence Division has not investigated counterintelligence risks arising from President Trump’s foreign financial ties”*, and that Mueller, too, **avoided delving into Trump’s finances** ([Schiff says FBI hasn't probed national security risks of Trump's foreign financial ties - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/26/adam-schiff-fbi-trump-foreign-financial-ties-402318#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBased%20on%20the%20Committee%E2%80%99s%20review%2C,about%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20foreign%20financial%20entanglements)). This suggested a major gap in the official inquiries: no U.S. agency had fully traced **Trump’s complex web of deals with foreign (including Russian) individuals** to assess if they posed a security threat. Schiff’s committee therefore subpoenaed Deutsche Bank for Trump’s records. After protracted litigation (including a Supreme Court ruling in 2020 that forced narrower scope), Deutsche Bank reportedly began complying in late 2021 by turning over some records to Congress ([

](https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1042#:~:text=In%20February%202019%2C%20Schiff%20announced,them%2C%20remains%20urgent%20and%20outstanding)) ([Deutsche Bank cuts ties with Trump after Capitol attack - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/12/deutsche-bank-cuts-ties-trump-458193#:~:text=Deutsche%20Bank%E2%80%99s%20break%20with%20Trump,Supreme%20Court)). However, any findings from these records were not made public before the House flipped control. By 2023, House Republicans not only dropped these inquiries but launched their own investigations casting Trump as the victim (examining supposed bias in the FBI’s Russia probe, for instance). Thus, no public congressional report ever fully answered the lingering questions about **Trump’s foreign loans, investors, and property sales**. Key members like Senator Ron Wyden continued to voice concerns – Wyden had earlier probed Trump’s 2008 sale of a Florida mansion to a Russian oligarch at an inflated price, suspecting money laundering – but these threads remained unresolved by 2025. What *did* emerge in the public record during this period were intelligence assessments reinforcing that **Russia had interfered in U.S. elections on Trump’s behalf** and was likely to do so again. In March 2021, the **U.S. Director of National Intelligence (DNI)** released a declassified report on foreign threats to the 2020 election. That report concluded, *“President Putin authorized”* influence operations aimed at “denigrating President Biden’s candidacy” and supporting Trump ([](https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ICA-declass-16MAR21.pdf#:~:text=Key%20Judgment%202%3A%20We%20assess,President%20Biden%E2%80%99s%20candidacy%20and%20the)) ([](https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ICA-declass-16MAR21.pdf#:~:text=Russia%E2%80%99s%20Efforts%20to%20Influence%202020,and%20conducted%20influence%20operations%20against)). It detailed how Russian intelligence proxies (like Ukrainian operative **Andriy Derkach**) fed misleading narratives about Biden to U.S. media and Trump associates in 2020 ([](https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ICA-declass-16MAR21.pdf#:~:text=Russian%20officials%20were%20aware%20of,activities%20of%20Andriy%20Derkach%2C%20a)) ([](https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ICA-declass-16MAR21.pdf#:~:text=uncovered%20revolved%20around%20a%20narrative%E2%80%94that,Russian%20intelligence)). This essentially confirmed that **Trump’s allies (e.g. Rudy Giuliani) had unwittingly interacted with Russian agents** spreading anti-Biden propaganda. While Trump dismissed these findings, intelligence officials and federal prosecutors remained alert to similar tactics in 2024 (as discussed below). The Biden-era Justice Department also pursued Russian espionage and influence networks more aggressively: for example, in 2023, a former FBI counterintelligence chief (Charles McGonigal) pleaded guilty to taking secret payments from a Russian oligarch, Oleg Deripaska – a staggering case of a top FBI official being co-opted by the very Russian influence he was supposed to combat ([Former MI6 officer: 'No doubt' Putin interfering to help Trump win](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSinGvlsbpY#:~:text=Former%20MI6%20officer%3A%20%27No%20doubt%27,cut%20off%20aid%20to%20Kyiv)). Although the McGonigal case did not directly involve Trump, it underscored the reach of Russian money into American institutions and bolstered Trump’s narrative that FBI leadership was “corrupt” (albeit not in the way Trump meant). 

On the international front, **foreign intelligence assessments and reactions** underscored the global stakes of Trump’s Russia ties. Allies in Europe, having endured four years of Trump’s unpredictable approach, remained wary post-2021. For instance, Britain’s Parliament and security services had earlier identified Russian meddling in U.K. politics and noted the Trump-era U.S. response was hampered by Trump’s own ambivalence about confronting Putin. In 2022, as the Ukraine war raged, Western intelligence officials quietly fretted about Trump’s sympathetic stance toward Putin. By late 2024, this concern burst into the open. **Sir Richard Moore, chief of MI6 (Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service)**, delivered a rare public speech warning that if the West wavered in supporting Ukraine, Putin would be emboldened to threaten European security ([World at most dangerous point in 40 years, MI6 chief warns | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/uk/home-news/mi6-chief-richard-moore-putin-russia-ukraine-b2656425.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIn%2037%20years%20in%20the,he%20will%20not%20stop%20there%E2%80%9D)) ([World at most dangerous point in 40 years, MI6 chief warns | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/uk/home-news/mi6-chief-richard-moore-putin-russia-ukraine-b2656425.html#:~:text=Sir%20Richard%20said%20MI6%20%E2%80%9Ccherishes,is%20sending%20to%20help%20Kyiv)). Moore pointedly said that if Putin succeeded in Ukraine, *“he will not stop there,”* and stressed that the cost of not supporting Ukraine would be far higher in the long run ([World at most dangerous point in 40 years, MI6 chief warns | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/uk/home-news/mi6-chief-richard-moore-putin-russia-ukraine-b2656425.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIn%2037%20years%20in%20the,he%20will%20not%20stop%20there%E2%80%9D)) ([World at most dangerous point in 40 years, MI6 chief warns | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/uk/home-news/mi6-chief-richard-moore-putin-russia-ukraine-b2656425.html#:~:text=message%20to%20president,is%20sending%20to%20help%20Kyiv)). Significantly, the *Independent* reported that Moore’s remarks “appeared a message to president-elect Donald Trump,” noting Trump’s repeated complaints about U.S. aid to Kyiv ([World at most dangerous point in 40 years, MI6 chief warns | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/uk/home-news/mi6-chief-richard-moore-putin-russia-ukraine-b2656425.html#:~:text=Sir%20Richard%20said%20MI6%20%E2%80%9Ccherishes,is%20sending%20to%20help%20Kyiv)). In other words, **Britain’s spy chief issued a veiled rebuke of Trump’s position**, emphasizing that a potential second Trump presidency, inclined to cut off Ukraine, would jeopardize both European and transatlantic security. European allies were essentially cautioning that **Trump’s return could play into Putin’s hands**. Meanwhile, other foreign intelligence and security experts speculated that Russia was indeed **betting on Trump in 2024**. An example came from a former MI6 officer who stated there was “no doubt” Putin’s security apparatus would try to help Trump win again, seeing Trump as favorable to Russia’s strategic aims ([Former MI6 officer: 'No doubt' Putin interfering to help Trump win](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSinGvlsbpY#:~:text=Former%20MI6%20officer%3A%20%27No%20doubt%27,cut%20off%20aid%20to%20Kyiv)). This view – that Moscow preferred Trump and was actively working toward that outcome – was echoed in analyses by NATO-aligned think tanks. Such assessments, while not official government policy, reflected a broad consensus in Western security circles: Trump’s past and present posture toward Russia was a wild card, if not a liability, for the collective stance against Kremlin aggression. In summary, the **legal and investigative landscape from 2021–2025** saw Trump escaping any direct penalties for his Russian links, even as **U.S. intelligence reaffirmed Russia’s malign influence and U.S. allies sounded alarms** about Trump’s potential to undermine the united front against Putin. The stage was thus set for the 2024 election, where these issues would resurface in the political arena.

**Trump’s 2024 Presidential Campaign and Russia.** Trump’s bid to regain the presidency in 2024 unfolded against the dramatic backdrop of the Ukraine war and heightened East–West tensions – a context that put his Russia stance under the microscope. From the outset of the campaign (he announced his candidacy in November 2022), **Russian state media and officials made little secret of their preference** for Trump over President Biden. While the Kremlin maintained a formal posture of neutrality – Putin and his spokesmen insisted “it makes no difference” to Moscow who wins the U.S. election ([Russian state media flatters Trump, but Kremlin cool on him and Harris | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/russian-state-media-flatters-trump-kremlin-cool-him-harris-2024-10-22/#:~:text=MOSCOW%2C%20Oct%2022%20%28Reuters%29%20,Donald%20Trump%20is%20strongly%20favoured)) – the coverage on Kremlin-controlled television told a different story. Russian state TV overwhelmingly **favored Trump and disparaged his Democratic opponent**. In 2023 and 2024, flagship news programs on channels like Rossiya-1 and Channel One began highlighting U.S. culture-war issues in ways aligned with Trump’s talking points. For example, one Channel One segment in fall 2024 aired clips of billionaire Elon Musk and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson **denigrating Vice President Kamala Harris** (who at one point was rumored as a possible stand-in for Biden) ([Russian state media flatters Trump, but Kremlin cool on him and Harris | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/russian-state-media-flatters-trump-kremlin-cool-him-harris-2024-10-22/#:~:text=State%20TV%27s%20main%20Channel%20One,a%20series%20of%20stumbling%20performances)). The broadcast mocked Harris’s verbal gaffes and laughter, even noting Putin himself had commented sarcastically on her tendencies ([Russian state media flatters Trump, but Kremlin cool on him and Harris | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/russian-state-media-flatters-trump-kremlin-cool-him-harris-2024-10-22/#:~:text=stumbling%20performances)). In contrast, the same program portrayed **Trump as confident and full of common sense**, showcasing his statements on topics like immigration and transgender issues to appeal to conservative sensibilities ([Russian state media flatters Trump, but Kremlin cool on him and Harris | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/russian-state-media-flatters-trump-kremlin-cool-him-harris-2024-10-22/#:~:text=By%20contrast%2C%20the%20same%20Channel,as%20evidenced%20by%20assassination%20plots)). Russian pundits painted Trump as a strong leader “fighting sinister forces” (echoing Trump’s own portrayal of being persecuted by the “Deep State”) ([Russian state media flatters Trump, but Kremlin cool on him and Harris | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/russian-state-media-flatters-trump-kremlin-cool-him-harris-2024-10-22/#:~:text=TV%20has%20played%20compilations%20of,eloquent%20statements%20during%20the%20campaign)). Such coverage amounted to a not-so-subtle **propaganda boost for Trump’s candidacy**. Notably, one Russian state TV host declared that a Trump victory would *“destroy America from within, which is good for Russia,”* an extraordinary on-air admission of strategic preference. In essence, Moscow’s media apparatus – undoubtedly guided by the Kremlin’s messaging directives – acted as a **foreign echo chamber for Trump’s campaign themes**, reinforcing Russian public opinion in his favor and even seeding pro-Trump narratives back into U.S. social media via clips and commentary. This dynamic was acknowledged by U.S. intelligence: Russia was using overt propaganda to amplify divisive issues in the U.S., implicitly aiding Trump’s agenda of polarizing American voters ([Joint ODNI, FBI, and CISA Statement on Russian Election Influence Efforts — FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/joint-odni-fbi-and-cisa-statement-on-russian-election-influence-efforts#:~:text=This%20Russian%20activity%20is%20part,%E2%80%9D)).

Beyond media cheerleading, **direct Russian interference efforts** were detected as the 2024 election approached. U.S. agencies issued multiple public warnings that Moscow was again engaging in covert influence operations to sway the election. In November 2024 (just before Election Day), the Office of the DNI, FBI, and Department of Homeland Security **revealed a specific Russian disinformation plot**: agents of Russia had manufactured and circulated a fake video purporting to show “individuals from Haiti” illegally voting in Georgia ([Joint ODNI, FBI, and CISA Statement on Russian Election Influence Efforts — FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/joint-odni-fbi-and-cisa-statement-on-russian-election-influence-efforts#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20IC%20assesses%20that%20Russian,the%20video%E2%80%99s%20claims%20as%20false)). This fabricated video aimed to undermine confidence in U.S. election integrity by stoking fears of voter fraud – a narrative that conveniently dovetailed with Trump’s own false claims about elections being “stolen.” The joint intelligence statement explained that this activity was part of **Moscow’s broader effort to “sow divisions” and “raise unfounded questions about the integrity of the U.S. election.”** ([Joint ODNI, FBI, and CISA Statement on Russian Election Influence Efforts — FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/joint-odni-fbi-and-cisa-statement-on-russian-election-influence-efforts#:~:text=Russian%20influence%20actors%20also%20manufactured,entertainer)) In another instance, the agencies noted Russia had concocted a fake video accusing a person associated with the Democratic ticket of accepting a bribe from a celebrity ([Joint ODNI, FBI, and CISA Statement on Russian Election Influence Efforts — FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/joint-odni-fbi-and-cisa-statement-on-russian-election-influence-efforts#:~:text=refuted%20the%20video%E2%80%99s%20claims%20as,false)). These influence efforts showed the Kremlin was not merely commenting from the sidelines; it was **actively injecting deceptive content into the U.S. information ecosystem**, likely to benefit Trump by smearing his opponents and validating his supporters’ suspicions about election fraud. Federal prosecutors also took action: in September 2024, the Justice Department announced the **takedown of a Russian malign influence operation code-named “Doppelganger.”** This operation, allegedly run by a Putin-linked PR firm and sanctioned by a top Kremlin official (Sergei Kiriyenko), had **created dozens of fake websites mimicking news outlets** in order to disseminate propaganda targeting U.S. and European audiences ([ Office of Public Affairs |  Justice Department Disrupts Covert Russian Government-Sponsored Foreign Malign Influence Operation Targeting Audiences in the United States and Elsewhere | United States Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-disrupts-covert-russian-government-sponsored-foreign-malign-influence#:~:text=Russian%20companies%20Social%20Design%20Agency,2024%20Presidential%20Election)) ([ Office of Public Affairs |  Justice Department Disrupts Covert Russian Government-Sponsored Foreign Malign Influence Operation Targeting Audiences in the United States and Elsewhere | United States Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-disrupts-covert-russian-government-sponsored-foreign-malign-influence#:~:text=the%20designation%20of%2010%20individuals,the%20Treasury%20Department%20in%20March)). According to DOJ, “Project Doppelganger” aimed to *“bolster pro-Russian policies and interests, and influence voters in… the U.S. 2024 Presidential Election.”* ([ Office of Public Affairs |  Justice Department Disrupts Covert Russian Government-Sponsored Foreign Malign Influence Operation Targeting Audiences in the United States and Elsewhere | United States Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-disrupts-covert-russian-government-sponsored-foreign-malign-influence#:~:text=Russian%20companies%20Social%20Design%20Agency,2024%20Presidential%20Election)) The U.S. government seized 32 internet domains used in this scheme and Treasury sanctioned ten individuals involved ([ Office of Public Affairs |  Justice Department Disrupts Covert Russian Government-Sponsored Foreign Malign Influence Operation Targeting Audiences in the United States and Elsewhere | United States Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-disrupts-covert-russian-government-sponsored-foreign-malign-influence#:~:text=Russian%20policies%20and%20interests%2C%20and,2024%20Presidential%20Election)) ([ Office of Public Affairs |  Justice Department Disrupts Covert Russian Government-Sponsored Foreign Malign Influence Operation Targeting Audiences in the United States and Elsewhere | United States Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-disrupts-covert-russian-government-sponsored-foreign-malign-influence#:~:text=In%20conjunction%20with%20the%20domain,the%20Treasury%20Department%20in%20March)). Among the messages pushed by these Russian covert sites were themes like undermining support for Ukraine and criticizing Biden – again aligning with Trump’s viewpoints. The implication of these findings is stark: **Russian interference in 2024 was real and ongoing**, employing more sophisticated digital deception than even in 2016. While no evidence has emerged that the Trump campaign coordinated with these efforts (and Trump himself would certainly deny any such link), the net effect of Russian operations clearly **favored Trump’s candidacy**. U.S. officials anticipated that Russia would continue releasing disinformation even after Election Day to foment distrust in the results ([Joint ODNI, FBI, and CISA Statement on Russian Election Influence Efforts — FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/joint-odni-fbi-and-cisa-statement-on-russian-election-influence-efforts#:~:text=This%20Russian%20activity%20is%20part,%E2%80%9D)) – a scenario reminiscent of 2016, but with the U.S. perhaps better prepared to counter it in 2024.

As for **Russian official support or contacts**, there were no publicized direct ties between Trump’s 2024 campaign and Russian government figures. After the scandals of 2016, Trump’s team was presumably cautious to avoid any hint of improper contacts. However, Russian political elites frequently signaled their viewpoints. For example, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev (now a hardline Putin ally) posted gleeful comments on social media about U.S. political chaos and hinted that a Trump victory would be welcomed if it led to Washington cutting aid to Ukraine. Such remarks were informal yet telling: Russia’s leadership saw *strategic upside* if Trump returned. Putin himself, when asked in late 2023 about the U.S. election, smirked that Russia would work with anyone but added that Trump had “distinctive” views that could improve relations. In a September 2023 forum, Putin even quipped that Trump was being prosecuted for political reasons, calling it “good” because it showed the rottenness of the American system – a rather backhanded endorsement that still signaled Putin’s *personal sympathy for Trump*’s plight. Meanwhile, **Russian disinformation targeting the campaign** also took more bizarre forms: U.S. prosecutors unsealed charges in 2023 against individuals who had **duped several American right-wing influencers** into spreading Kremlin-crafted propaganda. This operation enticed popular pro-Trump internet personalities to unknowingly share content generated by a Russian troll farm, ranging from memes about U.S. racial divisions to posts praising Trump’s policies ([Right-wing influencers were duped to work for Russian operation ...](https://apnews.com/article/russian-interference-presidential-election-influencers-trump-999435273dd39edf7468c6aa34fad5dd#:~:text=,Benny%20Johnson%20%E2%80%94%20was)) ([Justice Department Disrupts Covert Russian Government ...](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-disrupts-covert-russian-government-sponsored-foreign-malign-influence#:~:text=Justice%20Department%20Disrupts%20Covert%20Russian,directed%20foreign%20malign%20influence%20campaigns)). The influencers – with millions of followers – amplified Russia’s messaging unwittingly, demonstrating how the Kremlin leveraged Trump-aligned media ecosystems to its advantage. Even after being exposed, this scheme underscored a worrying reality: **segments of Trump’s base were effectively weaponized by Russian information operatives**, a dynamic likely to continue into 2024’s bitter online battles. 

On the question of **campaign financing**, no evidence has surfaced that Russia (or any foreign actor) directly funded Trump’s 2024 run. U.S. election law strictly prohibits foreign contributions, and Trump’s campaign filings show funding mainly from small-dollar donors and wealthy American supporters. However, watchdogs remained alert to indirect foreign money flows. In past cycles, Russians attempted to route money through intermediaries – for instance, in 2016, a Kremlin-linked banker and a Russian agent cultivated the NRA, which then spent heavily to support Trump ([Blunting Foreign Interference Efforts by Learning the Lessons of the Past - Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/blunting-foreign-interference-efforts-learning-lessons-past/#:~:text=)) ([Blunting Foreign Interference Efforts by Learning the Lessons of the Past - Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/blunting-foreign-interference-efforts-learning-lessons-past/#:~:text=Maria%20Butina%2C%20who%20began%20working,which%20included%20top%20National%20Rifle)). Additionally, Russian oligarchs like Viktor Vekselberg attended Trump’s 2017 inaugural events via American associates who donated to Trump’s inaugural committee, raising questions (unresolved by 2025) about whether those donations were reimbursed by foreign funds. For 2024, similar concerns lingered: could Russia use shell companies, straw donors, or friendly third-party groups to aid Trump? In July 2023, the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee’s then-vice chair Marco Rubio (a Republican) acknowledged receiving briefings on foreign funding threats and noted the **risk of foreign money in U.S. political organizations** was real, though he did not single out Trump. One concrete development was a **2022 federal indictment of Russian national Elena Branson** for acting as an unregistered agent and allegedly arranging a donation to Trump’s campaign in 2020 through a proxy – an incident that, while isolated, showed the means by which Russia might try to cultivate influence covertly. Ultimately, by the start of 2024 there was no “smoking gun” of illicit Russian funding for Trump, but the *perception* of Trump being Russia’s preferred candidate was firmly established. Russian state media pundits openly expressed hope that Americans “come to their senses” and elect Trump, often arguing that Biden’s continuation meant escalation in Ukraine whereas Trump would negotiate peace favorable to Russia ([Former MI6 officer: 'No doubt' Putin interfering to help Trump win](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSinGvlsbpY#:~:text=win%20www,cut%20off%20aid%20to%20Kyiv)). In U.S. media, these endorsements became campaign fodder: Democrats painted Trump as *“Putin’s candidate”*, citing his own words and Russia’s overt propaganda for him, while Trump’s camp insisted he would simply pursue a pragmatic peace and that “nobody was tougher on Russia” than Trump when he wanted to be. As Election Day 2024 neared, it was evident that **Russian influence – both subtle and brazen – hovered over Trump’s campaign**, underscoring how unusually intertwined his political fortunes were with the interests of a foreign power antagonistic to the United States.

**Policy Implications and Comparative Analysis.** Trump’s post-presidency Russia ties and behavior have profound implications for U.S. policy, especially when contrasted with both past presidents and traditional Republican positions. **No former U.S. president in modern history has had the kind of personal business entanglements or openly admiring stance toward an adversarial leader** that Trump has with Putin. Typically, ex-presidents disengage from contentious foreign dealings and uphold a baseline of support for American democratic allies. In contrast, Trump as a private citizen continued to **entertain foreign business support** (e.g. the aforementioned $8 million from a Russian-linked source to his company) and to speak glowingly of an authoritarian rival. This unprecedented situation raised alarms within the U.S. national security community. Intelligence professionals have quietly questioned whether Trump – as a potential future commander-in-chief – might be **compromised or at least conflicted** in his approach to Russia ([Schiff says FBI hasn't probed national security risks of Trump's foreign financial ties - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/26/adam-schiff-fbi-trump-foreign-financial-ties-402318#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBased%20on%20the%20Committee%E2%80%99s%20review%2C,about%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20foreign%20financial%20entanglements)) ([Blunting Foreign Interference Efforts by Learning the Lessons of the Past - Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/blunting-foreign-interference-efforts-learning-lessons-past/#:~:text=It%20remains%20unknown%20why%20the,Mueller%20fired%20in%20the%20immediate)). While the most salacious allegations (such as those in the unverified Steele dossier) were never proven, the pattern of Trump’s conduct – withholding critical comments about Putin, seeking out Russian investments, and dismissing U.S. intel on Russian threats – led some to conclude that Trump represents a unique **counterintelligence concern**. Indeed, throughout 2021–2025, reports emerged that U.S. allies were recalibrating how they share intelligence with Washington out of fear that sensitive information could leak or be misused if Trump or Trump-aligned officials returned to power ([How US allies may try to safeguard their intel ops from Trump - Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/21/us-allies-intel-sharing-trump-00205204#:~:text=Politico%20www,The%20CIA%20is)) ([Trump revealed highly classified material to Russian officials ... - PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/trump-revealed-highly-classified-material-russian-officials-washington-post-reports#:~:text=PBS%20www,regarding%20the%20Islamic%20State%20group)). During Trump’s presidency, he famously divulged Israeli-provided classified intelligence to the Russian Foreign Minister in an Oval Office meeting ([Trump revealed highly classified material to Russian officials ... - PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/trump-revealed-highly-classified-material-russian-officials-washington-post-reports#:~:text=Trump%20revealed%20highly%20classified%20material,regarding%20the%20Islamic%20State%20group)), an incident that stunned the CIA and allied agencies. Memories of such episodes remained fresh post-2021. Thus, one **policy implication** is that Trump’s continued closeness to Russia could **erode trust in intelligence-sharing among allies**. If U.S. partners fear that a future President Trump would side with Moscow or leak secrets, they may withhold crucial intelligence – making the world less safe. U.S. military leaders have also privately voiced concern: recall that in 2018, Trump considered pulling the U.S. out of NATO in private discussions, prompting then-Defense Secretary Mattis to reinforce the U.S. commitment. In 2024, similar fears were public – a former Trump National Security Advisor, John Bolton, flatly warned, *“In a second Trump term, we’d almost certainly withdraw from NATO.”* ([Could NATO survive a second Trump administration?](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/could-nato-survive-a-second-trump-administration/#:~:text=Could%20NATO%20survive%20a%20second,National%20Defense%20Authorization%20Act)) Such a move would be a geopolitical earthquake, essentially realizing Putin’s long-term objective of weakening the Western alliance. Even the **suggestion of U.S. wavering on NATO undermines deterrence** against Russian aggression, which is why generals and diplomats from both parties have been outspoken that Trump’s views pose a national security risk.

Comparatively, **past Republican presidents** from Reagan through Bush and even into the Obama-era GOP establishment took consistently hard lines against Moscow’s threats. Ronald Reagan, revered in GOP circles, called the Soviet Union an “evil empire” and built up NATO as a bulwark against it. George W. Bush, though he initially spoke of looking into Putin’s eyes and sensing his soul, turned sharply critical as Putin’s behavior worsened. Even traditional Republican campaign rhetoric has emphasized strength against Russia. Trump’s approach represents a dramatic break. He inverted GOP orthodoxy by **attacking democratic allies (Germany, Canada, NATO as a whole) more vehemently than he ever criticized Putin** ([Reagan-era Republicans aghast as Trump turns Russia policy on its ...](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/19/trump-russia-ukraine-reagan-republicans#:~:text=,relations%20with%20Russia%20and)). As a result, many Reagan-era Republican figures have been aghast. In early 2022, a group of Republican national security veterans published op-eds condemning Trump’s praise of Putin over Ukraine, calling it “**shameful**” and noting that it turns decades of U.S. policy “on its head” ([Reagan-era Republicans aghast as Trump turns Russia policy on its ...](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/19/trump-russia-ukraine-reagan-republicans#:~:text=,relations%20with%20Russia%20and)). They argued that **appeasing Moscow or undermining NATO** is completely contrary to the successes of the Cold War, where U.S. firmness and allied unity checked Russian (Soviet) expansion ([Reagan-era Republicans aghast as Trump turns Russia policy on its ...](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/19/trump-russia-ukraine-reagan-republicans#:~:text=,relations%20with%20Russia%20and)). Even officials who served in the Trump administration, like former Defense Secretary Mark Esper and General H.R. McMaster, have publicly warned that Trump’s instincts vis-à-vis Putin are dangerous and do not reflect the historical Republican stance. This intra-party debate suggests that Trump’s influence has pulled the Republican Party’s base away from reflexive anti-Russian views toward a more isolationist, even pro-Russian, outlook. Polls in 2023 showed a growing share of GOP voters opposed U.S. aid to Ukraine, aligning with Trump’s position – a remarkable shift from 2014, when Russia invaded Crimea and Republicans overwhelmingly demanded a stronger U.S. response. Thus, Trump’s post-2016 ascendancy appears to have **realigned Republican foreign policy**, creating a split between the traditional hawks and the “America First” faction that questions confronting Putin. The *policy implication* here is that if Trump (or a Trump-like figure) leads the U.S. again, we could see **U.S. foreign policy veer toward accommodation of Russia**, undermining bipartisan support for causes like Ukrainian sovereignty or NATO expansion. Such a shift would have ripple effects: European nations might seek strategic autonomy from an unreliable America; countries on Russia’s periphery (the Baltics, Poland) would feel exposed and possibly pursue their own military buildups; and adversaries like China would note a weakening of Western resolve.

From a **national security establishment** perspective, Trump’s recent statements and behaviors have only deepened concerns from his first term. The intelligence community worries that in a second Trump term, he might **purge officials who are seen as “anti-Russia”** (he has hinted at dismissing or even prosecuting those involved in the 2016 Russia investigation). Such actions could chill intelligence operations targeting Russian espionage or influence, effectively granting Moscow more freedom to operate. FBI and CIA veterans have indicated that during Trump’s tenure, counterintelligence initiatives related to Russia were sometimes slowed or stymied for political reasons ([Schiff says FBI hasn't probed national security risks of Trump's foreign financial ties - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/26/adam-schiff-fbi-trump-foreign-financial-ties-402318#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBased%20on%20the%20Committee%E2%80%99s%20review%2C,about%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20foreign%20financial%20entanglements)) ([Blunting Foreign Interference Efforts by Learning the Lessons of the Past - Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/blunting-foreign-interference-efforts-learning-lessons-past/#:~:text=It%20remains%20unknown%20why%20the,Mueller%20fired%20in%20the%20immediate)). Post-2021, these agencies redoubled efforts to counter Russian spies and hackers (for instance, multiple Russian cyber espionage rings were busted in 2021–2023). But they also quietly plan for how to handle classified info if Trump returns – an extraordinary reflection of mistrust in a U.S. president’s handling of secrets. Moreover, Trump’s legal troubles (the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case) revealed he had retained sensitive materials after leaving office, including documents possibly related to nuclear capabilities and foreign intelligence. The **worst-case fear** voiced by some analysts was that such information could be leveraged or revealed to foreign actors. While there is **no evidence Trump provided classified documents to Russia**, the mere fact he held on to them improperly – and his longstanding friendly disposition to Moscow – leads security experts to consider scenarios where Russian intelligence might seek to exploit his cavalier approach. The bottom line is that **Trump’s Russia ties and attitudes pose a multifaceted challenge**: internally, to the cohesion and morale of the U.S. security agencies, and externally, to the solidarity of the Western alliance. 

In comparing Trump’s post-presidency Russia stance to that of **other former presidents**, the contrast is stark. Jimmy Carter, for example, focused on humanitarian work and never intervened in foreign policy to praise Soviet leaders during the Reagan years. Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, after leaving office, largely refrained from undercutting their successors’ foreign policy, let alone aligning with adversaries. None of them had private business interests intertwined with geopolitical rivals. Trump, however, has shattered those norms. His simultaneous role as a businessman with international deals, a political leader with an active campaign, and an influencer with a devoted following has meant that **traditional guardrails between personal interest and national interest are blurred** in his case. For U.S. national security professionals, this is a case study in *emoluments and influence risks*: a former president with continuing foreign business entanglements is inherently a high-risk factor. It raises the question: **Can U.S. policy toward Russia ever be consistent and firm if a leading political figure may have financial or ego-driven incentives to go soft on Moscow?** This question will remain salient as long as Trump remains on the political scene. 

In conclusion, the period 2021–March 2025 shows a continuity of the Trump-Russia saga in new forms. Trump’s **business dealings** post-presidency didn’t introduce new Russian projects but underscored prior financial linkages (from condo sales to mystery loans) that keep attracting investigative interest ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=But%20in%20the%20United%20States%2C,documents%2C%20interviews%20and%20corporate%20records)) ([Trump’s Truth Social media company ‘propped up in 2022 by Russian-American under criminal investigation’ | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-truth-social-emergency-loans-b2522794.html#:~:text=The%20broadsheet%20cites%20leaked%20documents,role%20in%20the%20TMTG%20merger)). His **public statements** stayed remarkably pro-Kremlin – praising Putin’s “genius” while criticizing America’s closest allies ([Trump condemns Russia invasion; hints again at 2024 presidential run | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-condemns-russia-invasion-says-he-prays-ukrainian-people-2022-02-27/#:~:text=Trump%20had%20irked%20some%20Republican,pretty%20savvy)) ([Trump Speaks at CPAC 2023 Transcript](https://www.rev.com/transcripts/trump-speaks-at-cpac-2023-transcript#:~:text=match%20at%20L766%20and%20if,overnight%20mail%2C%20sir%2C%20I%20promise)). **Legal inquiries** wound down without pinning any Russian collusion on Trump, yet they highlighted systemic failures in addressing foreign influence ([Graham Statement on the Durham Report | United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/graham-statement-on-the-durham-report#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)) ([](https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ICA-declass-16MAR21.pdf#:~:text=Russian%20officials%20were%20aware%20of,activities%20of%20Andriy%20Derkach%2C%20a)). The **2024 campaign** demonstrated that Russia is not a bygone issue: the Kremlin arguably sided with Trump through propaganda and covert ops, seeking a more Russia-friendly U.S. administration ([Russian state media flatters Trump, but Kremlin cool on him and Harris | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/russian-state-media-flatters-trump-kremlin-cool-him-harris-2024-10-22/#:~:text=MOSCOW%2C%20Oct%2022%20%28Reuters%29%20,Donald%20Trump%20is%20strongly%20favoured)) ([ Office of Public Affairs |  Justice Department Disrupts Covert Russian Government-Sponsored Foreign Malign Influence Operation Targeting Audiences in the United States and Elsewhere | United States Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-disrupts-covert-russian-government-sponsored-foreign-malign-influence#:~:text=Russian%20companies%20Social%20Design%20Agency,2024%20Presidential%20Election)). And in the broad **policy context**, Trump’s posture toward Russia remains a defining – and dividing – element of U.S. foreign policy debates, marking a sharp break from historical precedent and prompting serious security concerns at home and abroad. Whether one views Trump’s Russian connections as benign overstatements of friendship or as genuine threats to U.S. interests, the **scholarly record from 2021–2025** shows a rich interplay of factual revelations, credible allegations, and ongoing speculation. What’s clear is that Trump’s Russia ties have not disappeared with time; they have evolved into a post-presidential test of America’s political and institutional resilience in the face of foreign influence. The years 2021–2025 have, in effect, been a continuation of the Trump-Russia story by other means – a story whose final chapters are yet to be written.
