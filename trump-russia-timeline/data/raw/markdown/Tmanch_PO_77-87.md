# American Public Opinion of the Soviet Union (1977–1987)

## Late 1970s: Détente Fanes and Growing Wariness  
In the mid-1970s, U.S.–Soviet relations warmed under *détente* (e.g. SALT I in 1972, Helsinki Accords 1975). Public opinion reflected this: by 1973 a majority of Americans had neutral feelings toward the USSR and nearly 20% expressed positive sentiment ([](https://gss.norc.org/content/dam/gss/get-documentation/pdf/reports/social-change-reports/SC15%20The%20Polls%20-%20American%20Attitudes%20Toward%20the%20Soviet%20Union%20and%20Communism.pdf#:~:text=From%20intense%20dislike%20of%20the,of%20the%20invasion%20of%20Afghanistan)). However, this goodwill eroded as tensions rose. Even before the decade’s end, polls showed Americans were suspicious of Soviet intentions. In 1978, only 7% believed the USSR was *just protecting itself*, while **59%** said Moscow sought world domination (with **23%** even feeling the Soviets *would risk a major war* to achieve it) ([](https://gss.norc.org/content/dam/gss/get-documentation/pdf/reports/social-change-reports/SC15%20The%20Polls%20-%20American%20Attitudes%20Toward%20the%20Soviet%20Union%20and%20Communism.pdf#:~:text=Russia%20seeks%20only%20to%20protect,23%2018%2039%2028%2034)). The Soviet invasion of **Afghanistan in 1979** then sharply drove up negative perceptions. Favorable opinions of the USSR **“fell sharply, reaching a low point” after Afghanistan** ([](https://gss.norc.org/content/dam/gss/get-documentation/pdf/reports/social-change-reports/SC15%20The%20Polls%20-%20American%20Attitudes%20Toward%20the%20Soviet%20Union%20and%20Communism.pdf#:~:text=From%20intense%20dislike%20of%20the,of%20the%20invasion%20of%20Afghanistan)). By 1980, overwhelming majorities viewed the Soviet Union as a global threat rather than a normal country, and few trusted its motives. For example, in early 1980 **73%** of Americans said the Soviets sought world domination (up from 57% two years earlier) ([](https://gss.norc.org/content/dam/gss/get-documentation/pdf/reports/social-change-reports/SC15%20The%20Polls%20-%20American%20Attitudes%20Toward%20the%20Soviet%20Union%20and%20Communism.pdf#:~:text=Russia%20seeks%20to%20compete%20with,II%206%204%208%207)). In short, the late ’70s saw a shift from tentative trust back to Cold War distrust as détente collapsed.

## Early 1980s: Heightened Hostility and Distrust  
The first half of the 1980s marked a **“Second Cold War”** in American minds. Public sentiment toward Russia was overwhelmingly negative. President Reagan’s hardline stance – famously calling the USSR an “evil empire” in 1983 – resonated with many. A 1984–85 poll found **55%** of Americans agreed the Soviet Union was an *“evil empire that threatens our moral and religious values,”* while only 38% disagreed ([The Times Poll : Americans Look More Favorably on Soviets - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-12-20-mn-30191-story.html#:~:text=It%20was%20the%20other%20way,%E2%80%9D)). Perceived threat was extremely high: in 1985, **half of Americans** believed that *“someday we’ll have to fight the Russians in order to stop communism,”* indicating many felt an eventual war might be inevitable ([The Times Poll : Americans Look More Favorably on Soviets - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-12-20-mn-30191-story.html#:~:text=There%20also%20were%20other%20signs,years%20ago%20half%20thought%20so)).  Correspondingly, almost no one viewed the USSR as a friend or ally in this period – the vast majority saw it as unfriendly or an outright enemy. 

**Trust in the Soviet Union was exceedingly low.** Polls consistently showed Americans doubted Soviet honesty and intentions. By clear majorities, people did **not trust the Soviets to honor agreements**, especially arms control pacts ([The Times Poll : Americans Back Reagan but Limit Summit Hopes - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-11-17-mn-6917-story.html#:~:text=And%2C%20while%20the%20survey%20found,a%20favorable%20impression%20of%20him)) ([Americans Still Fear Russia - Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/2009/11/06/ussr-russia-communism-american-public-gorbachev-opinions-columnists-karlyn-bowman.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9D%20And%20in%20a%20Time%2FCNN,said)). In 1982, two-thirds of Americans believed Moscow wasn’t even interested in an arms agreement ([The Times Poll : Americans Back Reagan but Limit Summit Hopes - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-11-17-mn-6917-story.html#:~:text=about%20Gorbachev%20have%20a%20favorable,impression%20of%20him)). A **1985 Los Angeles Times survey** summed it up: there was *“a deep-seated apprehension about dealing with the Soviet Union, and a lack of confidence that the Soviets will abide by arms control agreements.”* ([The Times Poll : Americans Back Reagan but Limit Summit Hopes - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-11-17-mn-6917-story.html#:~:text=And%2C%20while%20the%20survey%20found,a%20favorable%20impression%20of%20him)). Most Americans in 1985 felt **less safe than five years earlier** – 58% said the U.S. was *“not as close to peace”* as it had been in 1980 ([The Times Poll : Americans Back Reagan but Limit Summit Hopes - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-11-17-mn-6917-story.html#:~:text=However%2C%2058,who%20were%20unsure)). In short, during the early ’80s Americans overwhelmingly viewed the USSR as a dangerous, untrustworthy adversary.

## Mid-1980s: Cautious Thaw with Gorbachev  
After Mikhail **Gorbachev** rose to power in 1985, U.S.–Soviet relations gradually improved and public opinion followed. A *“cautious optimism”* emerged ([The Times Poll : Americans Back Reagan but Limit Summit Hopes - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-11-17-mn-6917-story.html#:~:text=And%2C%20while%20the%20survey%20found,a%20favorable%20impression%20of%20him)). By late 1987 – after a series of summits and arms control talks – American attitudes had become markedly less hostile (though still wary). For instance, in a December 1987 LA Times poll a **57% majority** rejected the idea that the USSR was an “evil empire,” versus only 32% who still believed it ([The Times Poll : Americans Look More Favorably on Soviets - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-12-20-mn-30191-story.html#:~:text=Evidence%20of%20a%20new%2C%20guardedly,by%20Democrats%20and%20Republicans%20alike)). This was a *complete reversal* from a few years prior: in 1985 most Americans had indeed called the USSR evil ([The Times Poll : Americans Look More Favorably on Soviets - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-12-20-mn-30191-story.html#:~:text=It%20was%20the%20other%20way,%E2%80%9D)). Fear of inevitable war also declined; fewer than one-third in 1987 thought the U.S. would have to fight the Soviets someday, down from about half in 1985 ([The Times Poll : Americans Look More Favorably on Soviets - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-12-20-mn-30191-story.html#:~:text=There%20also%20were%20other%20signs,years%20ago%20half%20thought%20so)). And whereas **two-thirds** had described U.S.–Soviet relations as “unfriendly” in 1985, that dropped to roughly **50%** by 1987 as more people saw relations improving ([The Times Poll : Americans Look More Favorably on Soviets - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-12-20-mn-30191-story.html#:~:text=There%20also%20were%20other%20signs,years%20ago%20half%20thought%20so)). 

Notably, **Gorbachev himself gained a positive image** in American eyes. In late 1987, **58%** of Americans voiced a favorable opinion of Gorbachev (only 16% unfavorable) ([The Times Poll : Americans Look More Favorably on Soviets - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-12-20-mn-30191-story.html#:~:text=only%208,failure)) – a dramatic rise from November 1985, when just 33% were favorable and nearly half had no opinion of the then-new Soviet leader ([The Times Poll : Americans Look More Favorably on Soviets - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-12-20-mn-30191-story.html#:~:text=only%208,failure)). By 1987 many believed Gorbachev was **“different from previous Soviet leaders”** and genuinely wanted better relations ([Poll: Americans less worried about Soviets - UPI Archives](https://www.upi.com/Archives/1989/05/16/Poll-Americans-less-worried-about-Soviets/1225611294400/#:~:text=Seventy,percent%20said%20he%20wants)). A majority even felt the Soviet Union under Gorbachev was *no longer striving for global domination* in the same way ([More than three-fourths of Americans surveyed in a poll... - UPI](https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/12/11/More-than-three-fourths-of-Americans-surveyed-in-a-poll/4827566197200/#:~:text=Intermediate,by%20Reagan%20and%20Gorbachev)). 

**Despite this thaw, Americans remained cautious.** The public’s new optimism was *“guarded”* ([The Times Poll : Americans Look More Favorably on Soviets - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-12-20-mn-30191-story.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CPeople%20seem%20to%20be%20prepared,%E2%80%9D)) ([The Times Poll : Americans Look More Favorably on Soviets - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-12-20-mn-30191-story.html#:~:text=But%20Americans%20clearly%20are%20not,a%20strong%20strain%20of%20pragmatism)). For example, after the 1987 INF Treaty, polls found people split on whether the U.S. could **verify Soviet compliance** – slightly over half thought the treaty could be verified, while a large minority remained doubtful ([The Times Poll : Americans Look More Favorably on Soviets - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-12-20-mn-30191-story.html#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20when%20people%20were,by%20just%20five%20percentage%20points)). Nearly **50%** of Americans said they would insist on being “100% certain” the Soviets were complying, rather than give Moscow the benefit of the doubt ([The Times Poll : Americans Look More Favorably on Soviets - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-12-20-mn-30191-story.html#:~:text=And%20people%20also%20were%20of,exchange%20for%20obtaining%20a%20treaty)). Consistent with Reagan’s *“trust but verify”* mantra, Americans overwhelmingly supported strict inspection measures: by a 3-to-1 margin they favored extensive on-site inspections by both sides to enforce any arms pact ([The Times Poll : Americans Look More Favorably on Soviets - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-12-20-mn-30191-story.html#:~:text=nuclear%20weapons%20agreement,exchange%20for%20obtaining%20a%20treaty)). And even as they welcomed Soviet concessions, Americans hadn’t wholly revised their view of Soviet geopolitics – in late 1987, **65%** agreed that even if the USSR withdrew its troops from Afghanistan, it *“could not be trusted”* to leave behind anything but a puppet regime ([The Times Poll : Americans Look More Favorably on Soviets - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-12-20-mn-30191-story.html#:~:text=Likewise%2C%20they%20tended%20to%20believe,%E2%80%9D)). In summary, by 1987 American sentiment toward the USSR had warmed significantly (fewer saw an “evil empire” or inevitable war), but **fundamental mistrust lingered**, especially regarding Soviet honesty and long-term intentions.

## Openness to Business and Personal Contact  
Importantly, **Americans’ Cold War skepticism was largely directed at the Soviet government and its policies – not the Soviet people.** There was little inherent animosity toward Russians as individuals. In fact, U.S. surveys over the years showed *“no special enmity toward the Russian people.”* For example, even at the height of the Cold War in the 1950s, a majority had a favorable impression of “the Russian people” as distinct from their leaders. This distinction persisted. In the 1980s, many Americans were cautiously willing to engage with Soviet citizens through trade, travel, and cultural exchanges, despite political tensions.

**Polls consistently showed strong support for peaceful engagement:** Americans favored diplomacy, trade, and people-to-people contact as ways to reduce hostilities. Large majorities agreed the U.S. should *keep talking* with Moscow. In 1982 – at the peak of Cold War tensions – **77%** of Americans approved of *“negotiating arms control agreements between the U.S. and the Soviet Union,”* and support remained around 80% through the 1980s. Similarly, Americans generally approved of **trade** with the USSR as long as it served U.S. interests. (For instance, back in 1975 a majority supported granting the Soviet Union normal trading privileges, though Congress tied this to Soviet human rights via the Jackson-Vanik Amendment.) While punitive measures like the 1980 grain embargo had some public backing in response to Afghanistan, many Americans (and especially farmers) soon favored resuming grain sales ([Farmers Swept Up In Trade Wars Remember '80s Grain Embargo](https://www.npr.org/2018/08/16/639149657/farmers-caught-up-in-u-s-trade-war-s-remember-80-s-grain-embargo#:~:text=Farmers%20Swept%20Up%20In%20Trade,crisis%20since%20the%20Great%20Depression)), reflecting a practical view on doing business even amid rivalry.

Above all, **personal and cultural interaction was strongly encouraged by the public**. A November 1985 Los Angeles Times poll found *“wide support for U.S.–Soviet cultural exchanges,”* with Americans favoring expanded people-to-people contact by more than **8-to-1** ([The Times Poll : Americans Back Reagan but Limit Summit Hopes - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-11-17-mn-6917-story.html#:~:text=if%20all%20Americans%20were%20surveyed,in%20the%20same%20way)). In that survey – conducted on the eve of the Geneva Summit – Americans enthusiastically backed exchanges in culture, sports, education, and the arts as a way to humanize relations ([The Times Poll : Americans Back Reagan but Limit Summit Hopes - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-11-17-mn-6917-story.html#:~:text=if%20all%20Americans%20were%20surveyed,in%20the%20same%20way)). President Reagan’s call for **“the broadest people-to-people exchanges in the history of American–Soviet relations”** was extremely well received ([The Times Poll : Americans Back Reagan but Limit Summit Hopes - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-11-17-mn-6917-story.html#:~:text=if%20all%20Americans%20were%20surveyed,in%20the%20same%20way)). This suggests that **Americans were quite comfortable interacting with individual Soviets** – hosting students, meeting business counterparts, or other personal dealings – even if they remained wary of the Soviet state. 

In practical terms, an American in the 1980s might not *trust* Soviet officials at the negotiating table, but they often expressed openness – even eagerness – for **business or personal engagements** that could build understanding. By 1987, with tensions easing, a growing share of the U.S. public was ready to “enter a new era in Soviet-American relations” ([The Times Poll : Americans Look More Favorably on Soviets - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-12-20-mn-30191-story.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CPeople%20seem%20to%20be%20prepared,%E2%80%9D)). They supported joint ventures and cultural visits (for example, American tourism to the USSR ticked up in the late ’80s ([Gorbachev Sparks New Interest : More Americans Visiting Soviet ...](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-07-18-mn-723-story.html#:~:text=Gorbachev%20Sparks%20New%20Interest%20%3A,Gorbachev%20have%20sparked%20new%20interest))). In short, while caution and suspicion persisted at a political level, **American attitudes toward doing business or interacting with Soviet individuals were generally favorable**, grounded in a hope that personal contact could bridge the Cold War divide.

## Trends Summary Table (1977–1987)  
The table below highlights notable poll findings from 1977–1987 about Americans’ views of the Soviet Union, illustrating how sentiment shifted over the decade:

| **1985** | LA Times Poll | *Confidence in dealing with Soviets* (general sentiment) | Pollsters found *“deep apprehension”* and a **“lack of confidence”** that Soviets would honor agreements ([The Times Poll : Americans Back Reagan but Limit Summit Hopes - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-11-17-mn-6917-story.html#:~:text=And%2C%20while%20the%20survey%20found,a%20favorable%20impression%20of%20him)).  Most (≈66%) said USSR didn’t really want arms peace (March 1982); by late 1985 opinion was split on Soviet intentions ([The Times Poll : Americans Back Reagan but Limit Summit Hopes - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-11-17-mn-6917-story.html#:~:text=about%20Gorbachev%20have%20a%20favorable,impression%20of%20him)). |

(In 1984, it was the reverse – 55% called it evil ([The Times Poll : Americans Look More Favorably on Soviets - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-12-20-mn-30191-story.html#:~:text=It%20was%20the%20other%20way,%E2%80%9D)).)

## Conclusion  
**1977–1987 saw American opinion of the Soviet Union swing from wary optimism to deep mistrust and back to cautious hope.** In the late 1970s, détente-era goodwill was replaced by alarm after Soviet aggressions like Afghanistan. The early 1980s public was highly distrustful – viewing the USSR as a menacing, expansionist “evil empire” and a likely future enemy. Toward the end of the decade, however, attitudes brightened considerably. Gorbachev’s reforms and arms control efforts led many Americans to soften their stance: fewer saw the USSR as implacably evil, and a majority welcomed the prospect of peaceful coexistence. **Throughout this period, key opinion indicators (trust in Soviets, perceived threat level, willingness to engage) all fluctuated with world events:** for example, perceived threat spiked around 1979–83 and then eased by 1987 ([The Times Poll : Americans Look More Favorably on Soviets - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-12-20-mn-30191-story.html#:~:text=It%20was%20the%20other%20way,%E2%80%9D)) ([The Times Poll : Americans Look More Favorably on Soviets - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-12-20-mn-30191-story.html#:~:text=There%20also%20were%20other%20signs,years%20ago%20half%20thought%20so)). Notably, even at the height of tensions, Americans favored engagement (talks, trade, cultural ties) as a means to manage the rivalry ([The Times Poll : Americans Back Reagan but Limit Summit Hopes - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-11-17-mn-6917-story.html#:~:text=if%20all%20Americans%20were%20surveyed,in%20the%20same%20way)).
