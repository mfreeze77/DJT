# Chapter 4: Trump's Deepening Russian Entanglements (2001-2014)

The period from 2001 to 2014 represents a critical phase in Donald Trump's business evolution and his connections to Russia. Following his financial difficulties in the 1990s, Trump rebuilt his empire with a new business model that increasingly relied on foreign capital—particularly from Russia and the former Soviet states. This chapter examines how Russian money and relationships became progressively more important to Trump's business operations during this period, creating financial entanglements that would later raise significant national security concerns.

During these years, several key developments shaped Trump's Russian connections: his partnership with Bayrock Group (led by Soviet-born businessmen), his unusual relationship with Deutsche Bank (later implicated in Russian money laundering), the influx of Russian buyers into Trump-branded properties, and his 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow. By 2014, as Trump prepared to enter politics, he had established a complex network of business ties to Russia that far exceeded those of typical American real estate developers. These connections would later become the subject of intense scrutiny by intelligence agencies, investigators, and the media.

This chapter traces the evolution of Trump's Russian entanglements chronologically, examining how his business practices and public statements about Russia developed over time, and analyzing the implications of these relationships for his later political career.

## Trump's Financial Recovery and New Russian Connections (2001-2005)

### Trump's Business Model Evolution

By the early 2000s, Donald Trump had begun to rebuild his business empire following the financial crises of the 1990s. Having learned from his earlier overextension, Trump shifted toward a less capital-intensive business model. Rather than developing properties directly, he increasingly focused on licensing his name to other developers and taking a fee or percentage ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them)). This approach reduced Trump's financial exposure while allowing him to continue expanding his brand globally.

However, Trump still faced significant challenges in securing traditional financing. His history of bankruptcies and defaults had made most major U.S. banks wary of lending to him ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump's Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=with%20him,financial%20industry%20at%20that%20juncture)). This financing gap created an opportunity for alternative sources of capital—particularly from Russia and the former Soviet states, where newly wealthy individuals were eager to move money into Western real estate.

### The Bayrock Connection Begins

In 2003, Trump's business trajectory was significantly altered when he was introduced to **Bayrock Group**, a real estate development firm that would become one of his closest partners. Bayrock had been founded in 2001 by **Tevfik Arif**, a Kazakh-born former Soviet commerce official who had built businesses in Turkey and Central Asia after the USSR's collapse ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevfik%20Arif%20was%20born%20to,Ministry%20of%20Commerce%20and%20Trade)) ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=With%20the%20break%20up%20of,his%20firm%20the%20Bayrock%20Group)). Notably, Bayrock established its offices on the 24th floor of Trump Tower—just two floors below Trump's own office ([Felix Sater | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/felix-sater#:~:text=Felix%20Sater%20is%20a%20Russian,Russian%20and%20American%20organized%20crime)) ([Felix Sater | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/felix-sater#:~:text=firm%20with%20an%20office%20two,Russian%20and%20American%20organized%20crime)).

Arif had hired **Felix Sater** as Bayrock's managing director ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=his%20firm%20the%20Bayrock%20Group)) ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them)). Sater, a Soviet-born U.S. citizen, had a checkered past: in 1998, he had pleaded guilty to a $40 million stock fraud scheme linked to organized crime and had reportedly become an FBI informant ([Trump Org. to Cut Ties With Trump SoHo Developed With Sater, Bayrock - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-org-to-cut-ties-with-trump-soho-developed-with-sater-bayrock-2017-11#:~:text=Trump%20worked%20with%C2%A0Bayrock%20on%20at,scheme%20involving%20four%20Mafia%20families)). It was Sater who introduced Bayrock to Trump in 2003, pitching him on licensing his name to Bayrock's development projects ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them)).

Trump, impressed by Arif's international contacts, agreed to partner with Bayrock. They struck a deal whereby **Trump would license his brand and sometimes take an equity stake in Bayrock-led projects**, while Bayrock and its partners would provide the financing and development work ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevrik%20Arif%20hired%20Felix%20Sater%2C,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them)) ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=in%20Florida%2C%20Arizona%2C%20and%20New,expand%20his%20portfolio%20through%20them)). This arrangement would prove highly beneficial to Trump, allowing him to expand his brand with minimal personal capital at risk.

### Early Russian Buyers and Market Interest

Even before the Bayrock partnership fully developed, Trump properties had begun attracting Russian buyers. Following the pattern established in the late 1990s (as detailed in Chapter 3), wealthy Russians continued to purchase condos in Trump-branded buildings in New York and Florida. Real estate broker **Dolly Lenz** later revealed that she had sold dozens of units in Manhattan's Trump World Tower to Russian clients in the early 2000s, noting that *"If you didn't target the Russian billionaires, then you shouldn't be in the business"* ([A Timeline of Trump's Deals and Investments in Eastern Europe and Central Asia - The Moscow Project](https://themoscowproject.org/explainers/a-timeline-of-trumps-deals-and-investments-in-eastern-europe-and-central-asia/index.html#:~:text=trademark%20his%20name%20in%20Russia,%E2%80%9D)).

Among these purchasers was **Roman Abramovich's family**—Abramovich's wife Dasha Zhukova reportedly bought a condo in Trump World Tower around 2003. This influx of Russian buyers provided Trump with much-needed liquidity as he rebuilt his business empire.

### Trump's Initial Russian Market Explorations

During this early period, Trump began to express interest in the Russian market itself. In 2005, the Trump Organization signed a one-year deal with Bayrock Group to locate a Moscow site for a Trump Tower ([Trump Tower Moscow - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_Moscow#:~:text=Trump%27s%20interest%20in%20a%20Moscow,11)). Felix Sater—Bayrock's managing director—scouted a potential site and even planned to brand the spa "The Spa by Ivanka Trump" ([Trump Tower Moscow - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_Moscow#:~:text=Trump%27s%20interest%20in%20a%20Moscow,11)). This 2005–06 project did not materialize ([Trump Tower Moscow - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_Moscow#:~:text=branded%20,11)), but it marked the beginning of Trump's renewed efforts to establish a presence in Russia.

Trump's children also began playing key roles in exploring Russian opportunities. Donald Trump Jr. later recounted that he and Ivanka traveled to Moscow "many times" in the mid-2000s seeking deals, including scouting a Moscow golf resort in 2006 ([Trump's Moscow Tower Problem | Trump, Inc. | WNYC Studios](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/trumpinc/episodes/trump-inc-trump-moscow-tower-problem#:~:text=DONALD%20TRUMP%20JR,changed%20in%202005%2C%202006%2C%202007)) ([Trump's Moscow Tower Problem | Trump, Inc. | WNYC Studios](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/trumpinc/episodes/trump-inc-trump-moscow-tower-problem#:~:text=DON%20JR,at%20a%20potential%20golf%20development)). During a 2006 trip, Sater even arranged a tour of the Kremlin for Ivanka, boasting he got her to sit in Vladimir Putin's private office chair ([Felix Sater: 'I Arranged for Ivanka to Sit in Putins Private Chair' - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/ivanka-trump-putin-chair-felix-sater-russia-2017-8#:~:text=The%20first%20line%20of%20the,took%20in%202006)).

By 2005, Trump had established a clear pattern: he was actively courting Russian buyers for his U.S. properties while simultaneously exploring opportunities to develop Trump-branded projects in Russia itself. This dual approach would characterize his Russian business strategy throughout the period covered in this chapter.

## The Bayrock Years and Trump SoHo (2005-2010)

### The Trump-Bayrock Partnership

The partnership between Trump and Bayrock Group expanded significantly between 2005 and 2010, resulting in several high-profile projects. Throughout this period, Trump worked with Bayrock on at least **four projects** ([Trump Org. to Cut Ties With Trump SoHo Developed With Sater, Bayrock - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-org-to-cut-ties-with-trump-soho-developed-with-sater-bayrock-2017-11#:~:text=with%20nearly%20a%20decade%20ago,develop%20the%20troubled%20hotel%3A%20Bayrock)):

1. **Trump SoHo (New York City)**: A 46-story condo-hotel in Manhattan announced in 2006. Bayrock and the Sapir Organization (headed by Soviet-born billionaire Tamir Sapir) developed it, with Trump receiving 18% equity and management fees ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Their%20most%20high%20profile%20project,share)). Trump's children Ivanka and Don Jr. were closely involved in this project ([A Timeline of Trump's Deals and Investments in Eastern Europe and Central Asia - The Moscow Project](https://themoscowproject.org/explainers/a-timeline-of-trumps-deals-and-investments-in-eastern-europe-and-central-asia/index.html#:~:text=filed%20in%20Florida.%20,In%202011%2C%20Roger%20Khafif%E2%80%99s)).

2. **Trump International Hotel & Tower Fort Lauderdale**: A planned Florida condo-hotel. Construction began in 2005 but the project failed by 2009, ending in foreclosure (Trump had licensed his name; Bayrock was a developer partner).

3. **Trump International Hotel & Tower Phoenix (Scottsdale)**: A proposed hotel/condo in Arizona that never proceeded past initial stages (Bayrock had acquired land options).

4. **Trump Tower Moscow**: Bayrock and Sater also pitched Trump on a Moscow development around 2005–07, separate from the later Agalarov effort. In 2007, Sater lined up investors and a letter of intent for a Moscow Trump project – Trump even mentioned this deal in a deposition, though it fell through ([A Timeline of Trump's Deals and Investments in Eastern Europe and Central Asia - The Moscow Project](https://themoscowproject.org/explainers/a-timeline-of-trumps-deals-and-investments-in-eastern-europe-and-central-asia/index.html#:~:text=company%20defaults%20on%20its%20debt,files%20for%20trademark%20application%20in)).

The business structure of these deals was consistent: Bayrock would create single-purpose entities for each project and attract outside investors, while Trump would contribute his brand name and sometimes take an equity stake without investing significant capital. This arrangement allowed Trump to expand his brand with minimal financial risk.

### Bayrock's Russian and Post-Soviet Connections

From its inception, Bayrock was deeply intertwined with Soviet/post-Soviet networks. Tevfik Arif's background as a Soviet commerce official and his business connections across Central Asia and Russia provided Bayrock with access to investors and partners from the former Soviet Union ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=Tevfik%20Arif%20was%20born%20to,Ministry%20of%20Commerce%20and%20Trade)) ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=With%20the%20break%20up%20of,his%20firm%20the%20Bayrock%20Group)).

Felix Sater's connections to Russia were even more concerning. Sater's father had reportedly worked for **Semion Mogilevich**, a notorious Russian mob boss ([A Timeline of Trump's Deals and Investments in Eastern Europe and Central Asia - The Moscow Project](https://themoscowproject.org/explainers/a-timeline-of-trumps-deals-and-investments-in-eastern-europe-and-central-asia/index.html#:~:text=largest%20gasoline%20bootlegging%20operations%20in,Russian%20mob%20boss%20Semion%20Mogilevich)). Emails later revealed that Sater maintained extensive connections in Moscow; in 2015 he would boast, *"I can get Putin on this program"* regarding a Trump Tower Moscow deal ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump's Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=were%20exaggerating%20their%20relations%20with,%E2%80%9D)).

Bayrock actively sought capital from wealthy ex-Soviet individuals. In 2007, Bayrock secured a **$50 million investment from an Icelandic firm called FL Group** ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=In%202007%2C%20Bayrock%20secured%20%2450,all%20signed%20paperwork%20indicating)). According to later court filings, FL Group was **"preferred by wealthy Russians 'in favor with' President Putin"**, implying that some of the funds Bayrock put into Trump developments (like Trump SoHo) came from oligarch-connected sources ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=In%202007%2C%20Bayrock%20secured%20%2450,all%20signed%20paperwork%20indicating)).

### Trump SoHo: Development, Marketing, and Legal Issues

**Trump SoHo** was the signature Trump-Bayrock collaboration and encapsulates the nature of their partnership. Announced in 2006 with great fanfare (Trump and his children appeared with Arif and Sater to launch it ([A Timeline of Trump's Deals and Investments in Eastern Europe and Central Asia - The Moscow Project](https://themoscowproject.org/explainers/a-timeline-of-trumps-deals-and-investments-in-eastern-europe-and-central-asia/index.html#:~:text=filed%20in%20Florida.%20,In%202011%2C%20Roger%20Khafif%E2%80%99s))), the project opened in 2010.

From the beginning, Trump SoHo was marketed heavily to Russian buyers. One marketing agent said *"As the past few years show, the best property buyers now are Russian"* ([A Timeline of Trump's Deals and Investments in Eastern Europe and Central Asia - The Moscow Project](https://themoscowproject.org/explainers/a-timeline-of-trumps-deals-and-investments-in-eastern-europe-and-central-asia/index.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAs%20the%20experience%20of%20the,%E2%80%9D)) during the sales push. Inside Trump SoHo, sales agents like **Igor Bogomolny** aggressively targeted Russian investors ([A Timeline of Trump's Deals and Investments in Eastern Europe and Central Asia - The Moscow Project](https://themoscowproject.org/explainers/a-timeline-of-trumps-deals-and-investments-in-eastern-europe-and-central-asia/index.html#:~:text=,the%20units%20to%20Russian%20consumers)).

By 2011, the project faced serious legal issues. Buyers who had been promised robust sales figures sued, alleging that the Trumps and Bayrock **misled them about the condo sell-through rates**. The Manhattan District Attorney investigated claims that Ivanka and Don Jr. gave false information to buyers; ultimately the case was settled without criminal charges, with buyers receiving partial refunds ([Trump Org. to Cut Ties With Trump SoHo Developed With Sater, Bayrock - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-org-to-cut-ties-with-trump-soho-developed-with-sater-bayrock-2017-11#:~:text=,campaign%20colluded%20with%20Moscow%20during)) ([Trump Org. to Cut Ties With Trump SoHo Developed With Sater, Bayrock - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-org-to-cut-ties-with-trump-soho-developed-with-sater-bayrock-2017-11#:~:text=The%20Trump%20Organization%20will%20cut,and%20electoral%20victory%20in%20November)).

### Legal Controversies and the Kriss Lawsuit

The Bayrock relationship eventually led to significant legal troubles. In 2010, Bayrock's former finance director, **Jody Kriss**, filed a massive lawsuit accusing Bayrock's principals of fraud and racketeering. Kriss alleged that **Arif and Sater stole millions from him and others, laundered funds, and hid Sater's criminal record from investors and Trump** ([Trump Org. to Cut Ties With Trump SoHo Developed With Sater, Bayrock - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-org-to-cut-ties-with-trump-soho-developed-with-sater-bayrock-2017-11#:~:text=A%20lawsuit%20brought%20in%202010,conspiracy%3B%20bribery%3B%20extortion%3B%20and%20embezzlement)). In a 2017 ruling, a New York judge allowed parts of Kriss's suit (including racketeering claims) to move forward ([Trump Org. to Cut Ties With Trump SoHo Developed With Sater, Bayrock - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-org-to-cut-ties-with-trump-soho-developed-with-sater-bayrock-2017-11#:~:text=bribery%3B%20extortion%3B%20and%20embezzlement.)).

Kriss's complaint painted Bayrock as a **quasi-criminal enterprise** that used Trump's projects to launder illicit money – effectively accusing Trump's partners of using his brand to legitimize dirty funds ([Trump Org. to Cut Ties With Trump SoHo Developed With Sater, Bayrock - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-org-to-cut-ties-with-trump-soho-developed-with-sater-bayrock-2017-11#:~:text=fraud%20and%20money,four%20Mafia%20families)). While Trump himself was not a defendant in that case, the allegations underscore the reputational risk of his Bayrock ties.

Tevfik Arif had his own scandal: In 2010, he was arrested in Turkey during a raid on a $60M luxury yacht (once owned by Atatürk) where authorities charged that an underage prostitution ring was operating ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=In%202010%2C%20Tevfik%20Arif%20was,court%20acquitted%20him%20in%202012)). Arif was one of 10 people charged with human trafficking and running prostitutes for wealthy clients (reports said several Russian businessmen and Kazakh officials were on board) ([Kazakh businessman Tevfik Arif denies sex party allegations](https://www.theguardian.com/p/2mxdj/tf#:~:text=allegations%20www,prostitution%20ring%20aboard%20the)). He spent nearly two years fighting the charges and was acquitted by a Turkish court in 2012 ([Tevfik Arif | Committee to Investigate Russia](https://investigaterussia.org/players/tevfik-arif#:~:text=In%202010%2C%20Tevfik%20Arif%20was,court%20acquitted%20him%20in%202012)).

Felix Sater's criminal past also re-emerged publicly in 2007 when his records were unsealed, embarrassing Trump. In depositions in 2013, Trump downplayed his relationship with Sater, famously saying, *"If [Sater] were sitting in the room right now, I really wouldn't know what he looked like,"* even though Sater had had an office in Trump Tower and met with Trump frequently ([Trump Org. to Cut Ties With Trump SoHo Developed With Sater, Bayrock - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-org-to-cut-ties-with-trump-soho-developed-with-sater-bayrock-2017-11#:~:text=Trump%20worked%20with%C2%A0Bayrock%20on%20at,scheme%20involving%20four%20Mafia%20families)).

By 2010, the Bayrock relationship had become a significant liability for Trump, even as it had provided him with crucial financing and development opportunities during his business recovery.

## Financial Crisis and Russian Capital (2008-2010)

### The Rybolovlev Mansion Sale

The 2008 global financial crisis created new challenges for Trump's business empire, but it also coincided with one of his most profitable and controversial transactions involving a Russian buyer. In **July 2008**, billionaire **Dmitry Rybolovlev**—a Russian fertilizer magnate—paid Trump \$95 million for a Palm Beach, FL mansion (called Maison de L'Amitié) ([A Timeline of Trump's Deals and Investments in Eastern Europe and Central Asia - The Moscow Project](https://themoscowproject.org/explainers/a-timeline-of-trumps-deals-and-investments-in-eastern-europe-and-central-asia/index.html#:~:text=travels%20to%20Russia%20at%20least,ABC%20News%2C%20Sergei%20Millian%20describes)). Trump had purchased and renovated the property only four years earlier for about \$41 million. The **2008 sale price was more than double** Trump's purchase price, netting him a hefty profit even as the U.S. real estate market was crashing ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump's Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=billionaire%20Dmitry%20Rybolovlev%20is%20also,an%20investigation%20into%20the%20sale)) ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump's Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=the%20house%20for%20such%20a,an%20investigation%20into%20the%20sale)).

The timing and magnitude of this deal raised eyebrows. Senator Ron Wyden later asked the Treasury Department to review this **unusually lucrative deal for potential money-laundering** concerns ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump's Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=the%20house%20for%20such%20a,an%20investigation%20into%20the%20sale)). Special Counsel Mueller's team also reportedly examined the transaction ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump's Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=In%20a%202016%20interview%20with,prices%20were%20plummeting%20in%20the))).

Trump defended the sale, noting simply that he "sold it for \$100 million to a Russian" and chalking the markup up to property improvements ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump's Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=In%20a%202016%20interview%20with,prices%20were%20plummeting%20in%20the)). Rybolovlev never lived in the mansion and eventually demolished it and subdivided the property, fueling speculation that the purchase may have been more about moving money than acquiring real estate ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump's Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=the%20house%20for%20such%20a,an%20investigation%20into%20the%20sale)). Notably, in 2018 Rybolovlev appeared on a U.S. list of oligarchs close to Putin ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump's Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThat%20deal%20delivered%20so%20much,are%20considered%20close%20to%20Putin)).

### The Deutsche Bank Relationship

By the early 2000s, after his string of 1990s bankruptcies, Trump had trouble borrowing from most U.S. banks ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump's Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=with%20him,financial%20industry%20at%20that%20juncture)) ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump's Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=Trump%20Organization%20was%20prospering%20again%E2%80%94that,%E2%80%9D)). The major exception was **Deutsche Bank**, which became Trump's primary lender. In 2005, Deutsche Bank's commercial real estate arm provided a **$640 million construction loan** for Trump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago ([Trump sues Deutsche Bank over Chicago tower | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/business/trump-sues-deutsche-bank-over-chicago-tower-idUSTRE4A983H/#:~:text=The%20unfinished%2092,2009)).

When the 2008 financial crisis hit and condo sales slowed, Trump defaulted on the loan's payment. In November 2008 he brazenly **sued Deutsche Bank and other lenders for \$3 billion**, claiming the economic crisis was an unforeseeable "force majeure" that excused repayment ([Trump sues Deutsche Bank over Chicago tower | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/business/trump-sues-deutsche-bank-over-chicago-tower-idUSTRE4A983H/#:~:text=NEW%20YORK%20%28Reuters%29%20,Hotel%20and%20Tower%20in%20Chicago)). Deutsche Bank countersued, noting Trump still owed \$40 million personally guaranteed ([A Timeline of Trump's Deals and Investments in Eastern Europe and Central Asia - The Moscow Project](https://themoscowproject.org/explainers/a-timeline-of-trumps-deals-and-investments-in-eastern-europe-and-central-asia/index.html#:~:text=pouring%20in%20from%20Russia)).

Remarkably, rather than cutting ties, Deutsche Bank's **Private Wealth division** (led by banker **Rosemary Vrablic**) then began lending to Trump again ([Trump and Deutsche Bank: It's Complicated | Trump, Inc. | WNYC Studios](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/trumpinc/episodes/trump-inc-trump-deutsche-bank-its-complicated#:~:text=match%20at%20L504%20Rosemary%20Vrablic,point%2C%20is%20willing%20to%20do)) ([Trump and Deutsche Bank: It's Complicated | Trump, Inc. | WNYC Studios](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/trumpinc/episodes/trump-inc-trump-deutsche-bank-its-complicated#:~:text=Rosemary%20Vrablic%20and%20Donald%20Trump,point%2C%20is%20willing%20to%20do)). In 2012, Vrablic's team approved a **$106 million loan to Trump** for the purchase and renovation of the Doral Golf Resort in Florida ([Trump and Deutsche Bank: It's Complicated | Trump, Inc. | WNYC Studios](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/trumpinc/episodes/trump-inc-trump-deutsche-bank-its-complicated#:~:text=match%20at%20L561%20Trump%20flies,Bank%20loans%20him%20%24106%20million)).

Deutsche Bank's continued support, despite Trump's prior default, raised questions – especially since around the same period (2011–2015) Deutsche Bank was penalized for facilitating **major Russian money-laundering schemes**. In early 2017, New York regulators fined Deutsche Bank \$425 million for a "mirror trading" scandal that **moved \$10 billion out of Russia** through its Moscow, London and New York offices ([Trump and Deutsche Bank: It's Complicated | Trump, Inc. | WNYC Studios](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/trumpinc/episodes/trump-inc-trump-deutsche-bank-its-complicated#:~:text=VULLO%3A%20These%20flaws%20allowed%20a,York%20to%20their%20improper%20purpose)) ([Trump and Deutsche Bank: It's Complicated | Trump,

Deutsche Bank's continued support, despite Trump's prior default, raised questions – especially since around the same period (2011–2015) Deutsche Bank was penalized for facilitating **major Russian money-laundering schemes**.

These mirror trades involved clients buying stocks in Moscow and selling identical amounts in London, effectively laundering rubles into dollars ([Trump and Deutsche Bank: It's Complicated | Trump, Inc. | WNYC Studios](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/trumpinc/episodes/trump-inc-trump-deutsche-bank-its-complicated#:~:text=BERNSTEIN%3A%20So%20then%20what%20would,%E2%80%9D)). While there is no public evidence that these particular illicit funds directly financed Trump projects, the **coincidence** that Deutsche Bank was funneling vast Russian capital abroad at the same time it was Trump's chief financier has drawn scrutiny.

By 2014, Trump's debt to Deutsche Bank was sizable (reports indicate over \$300 million by 2016). This unusual financial relationship with a bank implicated in Russian money laundering would later become a focus of investigators examining Trump's Russian connections.

### Russian Condo Buyers During the Financial Crisis

As the U.S. real estate market crashed in 2008-2009, Russian buyers became even more important to Trump's business. A Reuters investigation found **at least 63 individuals with Russian passports or addresses bought \$98.4 million** worth of property in seven Trump-branded luxury towers in Florida alone ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida)) ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=But%20in%20the%20United%20States%2C,documents%2C%20interviews%20and%20corporate%20records)).

Many of these purchases occurred during or shortly after the financial crisis. For example, **Alexander Yuzvik**, a former executive at a Russian state construction firm (Spetstroi), purchased a $1.3 million apartment in the Trump Palace tower in 2010 ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=One%20wealthy%20Russian%20buyer%20was,an%20online%20real%20estate%20listing)). **Andrey Truskov**, co-owner of a Russian electronics and banking conglomerate, bought a $1.4 million condo in Trump Hollywood in 2011 ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=Andrey%20Truskov%2C%20another%20Trump%20condo,not%20disclose%20its%20financial%20results)). **Alexey Ustaev**, founder of St. Petersburg's Viking Bank, paid $1.2 million in cash for a Sunny Isles Trump Palace unit in 2009 and later $5.2 million for a penthouse in Trump Royale in 2011 ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=In%202009%2C%20Ustaev%20bought%20unit,2%20million)).

Another politically-connected investor, **Oleg Misevra**, a coal baron from Russia's Far East, paid $6.8 million in 2010 for the penthouse of Trump Hollywood via an offshore company ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=Many%20of%20the%20Russian%20buyers,and%20answer%20session%20with%20him)) ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20corporation%20Misevra%20controls%2C%20Swiss,respond%20to%20requests%20for%20comment)). Notably, some of these figures kept their U.S. holdings opaque (neither Yuzvik nor Misevra disclosed their Trump condos in required Russian asset declarations) ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=stepped%20down%20in%20March%202016)) ([Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=As%20a%20member%20of%20the,no%20mention%20of%20the%20apartment)).

### "Russians Make Up a Pretty Disproportionate Cross-Section of Our Assets"

In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, Donald Trump Jr. made a revealing statement at a real estate conference in New York. He said: *"Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets. … We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia."* ([A Timeline of Trump's Deals and Investments in Eastern Europe and Central Asia - The Moscow Project](https://themoscowproject.org/explainers/a-timeline-of-trumps-deals-and-investments-in-eastern-europe-and-central-asia/index.html#:~:text=apartments%20with%20cash)). This candid admission confirmed what industry observers had noted: Russian capital had become a crucial component of the Trump Organization's business model.

The timing of this statement is significant. It came just as the global financial system was collapsing and real estate values were plummeting. Traditional sources of financing had dried up, making Russian buyers and investors even more valuable to Trump's operations. The Rybolovlev mansion sale, which closed just two months earlier, had injected nearly $100 million into Trump's accounts at a critical moment.

In a similar vein, Eric Trump allegedly told golf writer James Dodson in 2014 that *"We don't rely on American banks. We have all the funding we need out of Russia"* when asked how the Trump Organization was financing new golf courses during a credit crunch ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump's Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=make%20up%20a%20pretty%20disproportionate,Trump%20denied%20making%20the%20comment)). While Eric later denied making this comment, it aligns with the pattern of Russian capital flowing into Trump ventures during this period.

### Russian State-Linked Capital in Trump Projects

There is evidence that Russian state-linked capital reached Trump projects via intermediaries. In 2010, Trump's Canadian partner **Alexander Shnaider** sold a Ukraine steel plant to the Russian government's bank **Vnesheconombank (VEB)** for \$850 million, and **about \$15 million of that went into finishing Trump's troubled Toronto Tower** ([Russian Vnesheconombank Helped Finance Trump's Toronto Hotel, Report Says - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-vnesheconombank-trump-toronto-hotel-2017-5#:~:text=The%20bank%2C%20Vnesheconombank%2C%20or%20VEB%2C,Street%20Journal%20reported%20on%20Wednesday)) ([Russian Vnesheconombank Helped Finance Trump's Toronto Hotel, Report Says - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-vnesheconombank-trump-toronto-hotel-2017-5#:~:text=to%20The%20Journal)).

Though Trump had no equity in the Toronto project, it bore his name and illustrates how **Russian state funds indirectly propped up Trump-branded developments abroad**. VEB was not an ordinary commercial bank; it was a Russian state development bank whose supervisory board was chaired by Vladimir Putin himself ([Russian Vnesheconombank Helped Finance Trump's Toronto Hotel, Report Says - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-vnesheconombank-trump-toronto-hotel-2017-5#:~:text=The%20bank%2C%20Vnesheconombank%2C%20or%20VEB%2C,Street%20Journal%20reported%20on%20Wednesday)).

By the end of the financial crisis, Trump had weathered the storm better than many real estate developers, in large part due to the influx of Russian capital through various channels: direct property purchases, financing via intermediaries like Deutsche Bank, and partnerships with developers who had access to Russian funds.

## Miss Universe and Pre-Campaign Positioning (2011-2014)

### The Agalarov Relationship

Trump's most significant business venture in Russia during this period was bringing the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow in November 2013. The key figures in this endeavor were Russian real estate magnate **Aras Agalarov** and his son **Emin**—who met Trump earlier that year at the Miss USA pageant in Las Vegas ([When Donald Trump brought Miss Universe to Moscow - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-russia-moscow-miss-universe-223173#:~:text=Soon%20after%20meeting%20Trump%2C%20the,cost%20%2420%20million%20to%20host)).

The Agalarovs were well-connected in Russia. Aras Agalarov had received the Order of Honor from Putin, one of Russia's highest civilian awards, and his Crocus Group had completed numerous government contracts ([When Donald Trump brought Miss Universe to Moscow - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-russia-moscow-miss-universe-223173#:~:text=The%20elder%20Agalarov%20was%20born,of%20honor%20on%20Agalarov%E2%80%99s%20lapel)). Emin was not only a real estate executive but also a pop singer who had married the daughter of Azerbaijan's president (though they later divorced).

In June 2013, Trump dined in Las Vegas with the Agalarovs and music promoter Rob Goldstone to cement the deal for hosting Miss Universe in Moscow ([Trump's Moscow Tower Problem | Trump, Inc. | WNYC Studios](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/trumpinc/episodes/trump-inc-trump-moscow-tower-problem#:~:text=BERNSTEIN%3A%20They%20pitch%20the%20Trumps,which%20Trump%20owns%2C%20to%20Moscow)). Agalarov agreed to pay Trump roughly **$20 million** for the hosting rights ([Following the Money: Trump and Russia-Linked Transactions From the Campaign to the Presidential Inauguration - Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/following-the-money/#:~:text=not%20trivial,168)). This payment was made through a complex structure involving a Swiss bank account and a Delaware shell company ([Following the Money: Trump and Russia-Linked Transactions From the Campaign to the Presidential Inauguration - Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/following-the-money/#:~:text=Agalarov%20used%20a%20Swiss%20bank,company%E2%80%99s%20president%20and%20director%20in)).

### The 2013 Miss Universe Pageant in Moscow

The Miss Universe pageant took place at the Agalarovs' Crocus City Hall in Moscow on November 9, 2013. For Trump, this event was not just about the pageant itself but about building relationships and exploring business opportunities in Russia. By Trump's own account, he saw the pageant as opening doors: "One of the great families in Russia [the Agalarovs] is our partner in this endeavor," he announced, adding that *"we wanted Moscow all the way."* ([When Donald Trump brought Miss Universe to Moscow - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-russia-moscow-miss-universe-223173#:~:text=Trump%20announced%20the%20venue%20in,%E2%80%9D)) Privately, Trump hoped the pageant would catalyze a long-desired Moscow real estate project ([When Donald Trump brought Miss Universe to Moscow - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-russia-moscow-miss-universe-223173#:~:text=great%20families%20in%20Russia%20is,%E2%80%9D)).

During his visit to Moscow, Trump networked extensively with Russian business and political figures. He later boasted that *"almost all of the oligarchs were in the room"* at the pageant finals ([When Donald Trump brought Miss Universe to Moscow - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-russia-moscow-miss-universe-223173#:~:text=The%20father%20and%20son%20are,%E2%80%9D)). Among the attendees was **Herman Gref**, the head of Sberbank (Russia's largest state-owned bank) and a close Putin ally ([Trump's Moscow Tower Problem | Trump, Inc. | WNYC Studios](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/trumpinc/episodes/trump-inc-trump-moscow-tower-problem#:~:text=DONALD%20TRUMP%3A%20,The%20richest%20men%20in%20Russia)).

Trump's public overtures to **Vladimir Putin** during this period were striking. Before the trip, he tweeted: *"Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant…if so, will he become my new best friend?"* ([When Donald Trump brought Miss Universe to Moscow - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-russia-moscow-miss-universe-223173#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20Miss%20Universe%20Pageant%20will,will%20bring%20our%20countries%20together%21%E2%80%9D)). While Putin did not attend the pageant, he reportedly sent Trump a gift and a warm note ([When Donald Trump brought Miss Universe to Moscow - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-russia-moscow-miss-universe-223173#:~:text=Putin%20sent%20a%20decorative%20lacquered,to%20meet%20with%20the%20American)).

### The Trump Tower Moscow Discussions

Throughout his Moscow visit, Trump discussed plans for a **"Trump Tower Moscow"** with the Agalarovs ([When Donald Trump brought Miss Universe to Moscow - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-russia-moscow-miss-universe-223173#:~:text=connected%20and%20with%20whom%20he,%E2%80%9D)). He even tweeted on his way home: "TRUMP TOWER-MOSCOW is next." ([Trump Tower Moscow - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_Moscow#:~:text=branded%20,11)).

The proposed Trump Tower Moscow with the Agalarovs advanced to discussions of sites and financing in late 2013, but ultimately **"died of deal fatigue" by the end of 2014** according to Donald Jr. ([Trump's Moscow Tower Problem | Trump, Inc. | WNYC Studios](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/trumpinc/episodes/trump-inc-trump-moscow-tower-problem#:~:text=projects)) ([Trump's Moscow Tower Problem | Trump, Inc. | WNYC Studios](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/trumpinc/episodes/trump-inc-trump-moscow-tower-problem#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%20Jr,understand%20the%20details%20of%20why)). Geopolitical events (such as early 2014 sanctions after Russia's Crimea intervention) likely dampened the prospects of that deal ([Trump's Moscow Tower Problem | Trump, Inc. | WNYC Studios](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/trumpinc/episodes/trump-inc-trump-moscow-tower-problem#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%20continues%20to%20look,This%20deal%20goes%20much%20further)).

The U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee's review of this trip (drawing on classified sources) found that **Trump was given an "escort" in Moscow – a young American businessman, David Geovanis, who was essentially assigned to squire Trump around the city** ([A Collusion Reading Diary: What Did the Senate Intelligence Committee Find? | Lawfare](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/collusion-reading-diary-what-did-senate-intelligence-committee-find#:~:text=The%20report%20documents%20in%20detail%E2%80%94including,the%20trip%20in%20which%20%E2%80%9CTrump)). There were rumors of lavish parties during the visit, and while much of the Senate's information on this is redacted, it hinted at the **possibility of kompromat** – compromising material – being gathered during Trump's 2013 stay.

### Trump's Public Statements About Russia (2011-2014)

Throughout 2011–2014, Donald Trump's public comments about Russia were generally positive or aspirational, reflecting either business interest or admiration for strong leadership. In a 2007 deposition related to a libel suit, Trump expressed bullishness on Russia: *"Russia is one of the hottest places in the world for investment."* ([Trump Org. to Cut Ties With Trump SoHo Developed With Sater, Bayrock - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-org-to-cut-ties-with-trump-soho-developed-with-sater-bayrock-2017-11#:~:text=,in%20the%20world%20for%20investment)) He even deemed it "ridiculous" to think he'd avoid Russia – signaling that he saw alignment, not conflict, with Russian interests.

After the Miss Universe pageant, Trump told **MSNBC** that Putin had "done a really great job of outsmarting our country" under Obama. He consistently contrasted Putin's decisiveness with what he considered weak U.S. leadership. For instance, at CPAC in March 2014, Trump said of Putin, *"He's a strong guy, although I don't like what he's doing,"* while lambasting President Obama as ineffective ([Trump Praised Putin on the National Stage Again — Here's What It Means - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-strong-leader-obama-2016-9#:~:text=system%20he%27s%20been%20a%20leader%2C,president%20has%20been%20a%20leader)) ([Trump Praised Putin on the National Stage Again — Here's What It Means - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-strong-leader-obama-2016-9#:~:text=positive%20thought%20from%20the%20Republican,about%20the%20autocratic%20Russian%20leader)).

Another recurring element was Trump's argument that the U.S. and Russia should be friendly. Returning from Moscow in November 2013, Trump said on Fox News, *"I know Russia well"* due to his pageant, and that the Russians he met **"want to be friendly with the United States. Wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along with somebody?"** ([When Donald Trump brought Miss Universe to Moscow - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-russia-moscow-miss-universe-223173#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20know%20Russia%20well%2C%E2%80%9D%20Trump,%E2%80%9D)). This sentiment – that fighting with Russia was unnecessary and partnership could be beneficial – was **a sharp break from the typical American political stance**, especially after Putin's 2014 annexation of Crimea.

By 2014, as tensions over Ukraine grew, Trump **criticized U.S. sanctions and responses** as weak, stating that Putin was "outsmarting" the Obama administration. He tweeted in March 2014 that Putin **"is playing [Obama] like a drum"**, signaling approval of Putin's savvy. These comments were not heavy on policy specifics but projected Trump's respect for Putin's assertiveness.

## Analysis and Implications

### Pattern of Russian Financial Entanglement

The period from 2001 to 2014 reveals a clear pattern of increasing financial entanglement between Donald Trump and Russian money. This pattern includes:

1. **Direct property sales to Russian buyers**, from individual condo units to the $95 million Rybolovlev mansion deal
2. **Business partnerships with Russian-connected firms** like Bayrock Group
3. **Financing from banks implicated in Russian money laundering** (Deutsche Bank)
4. **Indirect Russian state funding** through intermediaries (VEB's role in Trump Toronto)
5. **Direct business in Russia** (the Miss Universe pageant and Trump Tower Moscow discussions)

By 2014, these connections had created a significant financial relationship between Trump and Russian capital. As veteran journalist Craig Unger wrote, *"foreign money played a large role in reviving his fortunes, in particular investment by wealthy people from Russia and the former Soviet republics."* ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump's Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=But%20Trump%20eventually%20made%20a,%E2%80%9CRussians%20make%20up%20a%20pretty)). Trump's longtime architect Alan Lapidus put it bluntly: after U.S. banks shunned Trump, **"it was all coming out of Russia"** ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump's Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=Trump%20Organization%20was%20prospering%20again%E2%80%94that,%E2%80%9D)).

### Comparison to Other Developers

In the 2000s, many luxury real estate developers worldwide sold properties to rich Russians, as part of a broader wave of Russian capital flight into safe assets. High-end markets in London, New York, and Miami saw an influx of oligarch wealth. However, **Trump's pattern was somewhat atypical in scope and direct cultivation.** Dolly Lenz, who brokered Trump condos, noted that **Trump personally met and befriended many of her Russian clients** – *"They all wanted to meet Donald. They became very friendly."* ([A Timeline of Trump's Deals and Investments in Eastern Europe and Central Asia - The Moscow Project](https://themoscowproject.org/explainers/a-timeline-of-trumps-deals-and-investments-in-eastern-europe-and-central-asia/index.html#:~:text=65%20units%20in%20Trump%20World,%E2%80%9D)).

Moreover, Trump's business model after 2003 relied heavily on international licensing deals, and he gravitated towards partners from the former USSR (whether it was Bayrock in the U.S., the Agalarovs in Russia, or the Silk Road Group in Georgia). **Other comparable real estate moguls** like the Related Company's Stephen Ross or Vornado's Steve Roth largely used institutional financing and domestic partners, rather than seeking out investors from Russia.

Another contrast is that **Trump openly marketed to Russians** (with ads, translated websites, and PR events), whereas others did so more passively. In 2008, Eric Trump said about their SoHo project, *"We go where the money is, and nowadays the money is in Russia,"* which was a blunt admission ([A Timeline of Trump's Deals and Investments in Eastern Europe and Central Asia - The Moscow Project](https://themoscowproject.org/explainers/a-timeline-of-trumps-deals-and-investments-in-eastern-europe-and-central-asia/index.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAs%20the%20experience%20of%20the,%E2%80%9D)).

### Intelligence Community Assessments

By the end of our period (2014), intelligence assessments of Trump's Russian financial ties remained mostly **internal or classified**, only coming to light later. However, retrospective analyses by intelligence professionals connect the dots: Trump's **unusual deference to Putin, the long trail of Russian money in his businesses, and his public statements** all suggest to many in the intelligence community that Russia saw Trump as a favorable figure to **influence or even support**, based on mutual financial interests.

Former CIA Deputy Director **Michael Morell** stated in August 2016 that **"Putin had recruited Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation."** ([Senior ex-CIA official: Putin made Trump 'an unwitting agent' of Russia | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/senior-ex-cia-official-putin-made-trump-an-unwitting-agent-of-russia-idUSKCN10G1NS/#:~:text=Putin%20had%20flattered%20Trump%20into,in%20The%20New%20York%20Times)) He argued that Putin cleverly used **business flattery and deals** to gain Trump's sympathies, effectively leveraging Trump's financial and ego-driven vulnerabilities.

**British intelligence veterans** also weighed in: Former MI6 chief **Sir Richard Dearlove** said in 2017 that Trump's finances **"would have made him a target for Russian intelligence"**, given the debt and cash needs in the 2000s. He and others posited that **Trump's openness to Russian money** created a situation where Moscow could have **"leveraging information"** – not necessarily kompromat in the salacious sense, but simply knowledge of Trump's dependence on Russian funds which could be wielded implicitly.

The U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee's 2020 bipartisan report concluded that Trump's campaign was susceptible to Russian influence, in part because of **"Trump's previous business engagements in Russia and Ukraine"** (which include dealings during 2001–2014) ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump's Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=What%20remains%20unclear%20is%20whether,%E2%80%9D)) ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump's Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=were%20exaggerating%20their%20relations%20with,%E2%80%9D)).

### Potential Leverage and National Security Implications

The financial relationships documented in this chapter created potential leverage points that would later raise national security concerns. These include:

1. **Financial dependency**: By 2014, Trump had received significant capital from Russian sources, creating a potential dependency.
2. **Compromising business practices**: The legal issues surrounding Trump SoHo and other Bayrock projects could potentially be used as leverage.
3. **Knowledge of unreported transactions**: Russian intelligence would likely be aware of any problematic financial dealings involving Russian nationals.
4. **Ongoing business aspirations**: Trump's continued desire to build in Moscow (which extended beyond 2014) created an incentive to maintain good relations with the Russian government.

While there is no definitive evidence that Russia exercised this potential leverage during the period covered in this chapter, the financial entanglements created a foundation for potential influence that would become a major concern during Trump's later political career.

## Conclusion

The period from 2001 to 2014 represents a critical phase in Donald Trump's business evolution and his connections to Russia. Following his financial difficulties in the 1990s, Trump rebuilt his empire with a new business model that increasingly relied on Russian capital and partnerships with individuals connected to the former Soviet Union.

Key developments during this period included:
- The partnership with Bayrock Group and its Soviet-born principals
- The influx of Russian buyers into Trump-branded properties
- The unusual relationship with Deutsche Bank amid its Russian money laundering scandals
- The $95 million Rybolovlev mansion sale
- The 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow and relationship with the Agalarovs
- Trump's increasingly positive public statements about Putin and Russia

By 2014, as Trump prepared to enter politics, he had established a complex network of business ties to Russia that far exceeded those of typical American real estate developers. These connections created potential points of leverage and would later become the subject of intense scrutiny by intelligence agencies, investigators, and the media.

The financial relationships established during this period would have significant implications for Trump's subsequent political career, raising questions about potential conflicts of interest and susceptibility to foreign influence. As Trump moved toward announcing his presidential candidacy in 2015, these Russian connections—built over more than a decade—would take on new significance in the context of American national security and electoral politics.
