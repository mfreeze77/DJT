# Donald Trump’s Financial Dealings (2009–2012)

The period from 2009 through 2012 saw Donald Trump’s business empire navigate the fallout of the 2008 financial crisis, restructure major debts, and expand into new ventures. During these years, Trump’s real estate holdings underwent significant changes – from bankrupt casinos to new luxury projects – while his reality TV income and licensing deals provided critical cash flow. He also faced notable legal disputes and began intersecting more with politics (e.g. flirting with a presidential run and leveraging political connections). Below is a year-by-year account of Trump’s major financial events in 2009–2012, with a focus on real estate transactions, *The Apprentice* revenues, debt restructurings, legal battles, political-business intersections, liquidity moves, and business expansions or failures, all supported by detailed sources.

## 2009: Post-Crisis Restructuring and Casino Bankruptcy

- **Atlantic City Bankruptcy and Reorganization:** In February 2009, Trump’s casino holding company, **Trump Entertainment Resorts**, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, burdened by $1.2 billion in debt ([Trump Entertainment Resorts - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Entertainment_Resorts#:~:text=)) ([Trump Entertainment Resorts - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Entertainment_Resorts#:~:text=The%20casino%20group%20filed%20for,bankruptcy%20court)). Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka resigned from the company’s board just before the filing. Competing bankruptcy reorganization plans emerged: Trump aligned with bondholders (backed by Avenue Capital Group) to retain the Trump brand on the casinos, while financier Carl Icahn (who had bought much of the casino’s bank debt) proposed an alternate plan ([Trump Entertainment Resorts - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Entertainment_Resorts#:~:text=Trump%20initially%20made%20an%20agreement,agreement%20with%20Avenue%20Capital%20in)) ([Trump Entertainment Resorts - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Entertainment_Resorts#:~:text=City%20casino%2C%20the%20Tropicana.,name%20and%20likeness%20in%20perpetuity)). Trump warned he would fight to remove his name if Icahn’s group won control ([Trump Entertainment Resorts - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Entertainment_Resorts#:~:text=City%20casino%2C%20the%20Tropicana.,name%20and%20likeness%20in%20perpetuity)). Ultimately, the bankruptcy court approved a plan in which Trump *lost majority ownership* but **retained a 10% stake and a perpetual licensing agreement for his name** on the casinos (5% equity + 5% in exchange for use of his name and likeness) ([Trump Entertainment Resorts - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Entertainment_Resorts#:~:text=City%20casino%2C%20the%20Tropicana.,name%20and%20likeness%20in%20perpetuity)) ([Trump Entertainment Resorts - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Entertainment_Resorts#:~:text=group%27s%20properties.,name%20and%20likeness%20in%20perpetuity)). This meant Trump no longer controlled day-to-day operations or debt, but his name stayed on Trump Taj Mahal and other properties, and he could collect fees for its use ([Trump Entertainment Resorts - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Entertainment_Resorts#:~:text=City%20casino%2C%20the%20Tropicana.,name%20and%20likeness%20in%20perpetuity)). The restructured company exited bankruptcy under new ownership by mid-2010, relieving Trump of further personal obligations for the $1+ billion debt. In 2011 the company even sold one property (Trump Marina) to outside investors as it sought to stabilize ([Trump Entertainment Resorts - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Entertainment_Resorts#:~:text=The%20bankruptcy%20court%20eventually%20sided,32)).

- **Chicago Skyscraper Loan Default and Legal Dispute:** The financial crisis hit Trump’s biggest development, the **Trump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago**, which was nearing completion in 2009. Trump had borrowed **$770 million** for this project ($640 million from Deutsche Bank and $130 million from Fortress Investment Group) ([IRS Audit Could Cost Trump $100 Million — ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-irs-audit-chicago-hotel-taxes#:~:text=As%20his%20cost%20estimates%20increased%2C,the%20risk%20and%20potential%20gain)) ([IRS Audit Could Cost Trump $100 Million — ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-irs-audit-chicago-hotel-taxes#:~:text=As%20his%20cost%20estimates%20increased%2C,the%20risk%20and%20potential%20gain)), personally guaranteeing $40 million of the Deutsche Bank loan ([IRS Audit Could Cost Trump $100 Million — ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-irs-audit-chicago-hotel-taxes#:~:text=million%20for%20the%20project%20%E2%80%94,the%20risk%20and%20potential%20gain)). By May 2008, condo sales were far behind projections – only 133 of 825 units had sold, insufficient to repay the construction loans ([IRS Audit Could Cost Trump $100 Million — ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-irs-audit-chicago-hotel-taxes#:~:text=Trump%20planned%20to%20sell%20enough,revised%20cost%20of%20%24859%20million)). Trump missed the loan repayment deadline in late 2008 and **defaulted**, then took the extraordinary step of **suing Deutsche Bank in November 2008 for $3 billion** in damages, arguing that the 2008 global financial crisis constituted a “force majeure” that should excuse the debt ([Trump sues Deutsche Bank over Chicago tower | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/business/trump-sues-deutsche-bank-over-chicago-tower-idUSTRE4A983H/#:~:text=NEW%20YORK%20%28Reuters%29%20,Hotel%20and%20Tower%20in%20Chicago)) ([Trump sues Deutsche Bank over Chicago tower | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/business/trump-sues-deutsche-bank-over-chicago-tower-idUSTRE4A983H/#:~:text=All%20were%20identified%20among%20more,York%20City%20borough%20of%20Queens)). Deutsche Bank countersued for repayment. This legal standoff lasted into 2009, until Trump and the lenders reached a settlement. The **resulting debt restructuring (finalized by 2010)** was highly favorable to Trump: according to an investigation of his tax records, creditors ultimately **forgave about $270 million of Trump’s Chicago tower debt in 2010** ([President Trump had $270 million in debt on Chicago's Trump Tower forgiven: New York Times | FOX 32 Chicago](https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/president-trump-had-270-million-in-debt-on-chicagos-trump-tower-forgiven-new-york-times#:~:text=Trump%20%20owed%20them)) ([President Trump had $270 million in debt on Chicago's Trump Tower forgiven: New York Times | FOX 32 Chicago](https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/president-trump-had-270-million-in-debt-on-chicagos-trump-tower-forgiven-new-york-times#:~:text=forgave%20at%20least%20%24287%20million,bank%20of%20the%20Chicago%20River)). (In total at least $287 million in loans to Trump were forgiven, with the Chicago project accounting for $270 million ([President Trump had $270 million in debt on Chicago's Trump Tower forgiven: New York Times | FOX 32 Chicago](https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/president-trump-had-270-million-in-debt-on-chicagos-trump-tower-forgiven-new-york-times#:~:text=Trump%20%20owed%20them)).) Normally, canceled debt counts as taxable income, but Trump **paid little or no tax on this windfall** by using prior business losses to offset it ([President Trump had $270 million in debt on Chicago's Trump Tower forgiven: New York Times | FOX 32 Chicago](https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/president-trump-had-270-million-in-debt-on-chicagos-trump-tower-forgiven-new-york-times#:~:text=forgave%20at%20least%20%24287%20million,bank%20of%20the%20Chicago%20River)) ([President Trump had $270 million in debt on Chicago's Trump Tower forgiven: New York Times | FOX 32 Chicago](https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/president-trump-had-270-million-in-debt-on-chicagos-trump-tower-forgiven-new-york-times#:~:text=The%20IRS%20would%20normally%20treat,other%20parts%20of%20his%20business)). Trump later boasted of the deal, saying he “made a great deal” with the banks on the “very beautiful” Chicago tower rather than being “a bad guy” ([President Trump had $270 million in debt on Chicago's Trump Tower forgiven: New York Times | FOX 32 Chicago](https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/president-trump-had-270-million-in-debt-on-chicagos-trump-tower-forgiven-new-york-times#:~:text=The%20president%20responded%20via%20Twitter%3A,rather%20than%20a%20bad%20guy)). Notably, one of the lenders that forgave debt was an investment fund run by **future Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin**, highlighting an early intersection of Trump’s business with figures who would later become political allies ([President Trump had $270 million in debt on Chicago's Trump Tower forgiven: New York Times | FOX 32 Chicago](https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/president-trump-had-270-million-in-debt-on-chicagos-trump-tower-forgiven-new-york-times#:~:text=deal%20with%20the%20numerous%20lenders,rather%20than%20a%20bad%20guy)).

- **Real Estate Holdings and Purchases:** Despite financial strain elsewhere, Trump was still investing. In February 2009, he acquired the **Lowes Island Golf Club** in Virginia (800 acres in Loudoun County) and rebranded it **Trump National Golf Club, Washington, D.C.** ([Donald Trump buys Lowes Island Club - Washington Business Journal](https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2009/02/16/daily6.html#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%20has%20sealed%20a,golf%20courses%20in%20Loudoun%20County)) ([Donald Trump buys Lowes Island Club - Washington Business Journal](https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2009/02/16/daily6.html#:~:text=Chevy%20Chase%20put%20the%20700,KSI%20and%20Kettler%20%26%20Scott)). The club, which had been put on the market for $18 million by its previous owner, was bought by Trump for an undisclosed sum (Trump would only say he “paid a lot”) ([Donald Trump buys Lowes Island Club - Washington Business Journal](https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2009/02/16/daily6.html#:~:text=The%20club%20was%20previously%20owned,based%20Capital%20One%20Financial%20Corp)) ([Donald Trump buys Lowes Island Club - Washington Business Journal](https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2009/02/16/daily6.html#:~:text=Trump%20didn%27t%20disclose%20the%20purchase,paid%20a%20lot)). He immediately announced plans for extensive renovations to upgrade it to Trump-brand luxury ([Donald Trump buys Lowes Island Club - Washington Business Journal](https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2009/02/16/daily6.html#:~:text=site)) ([Donald Trump buys Lowes Island Club - Washington Business Journal](https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2009/02/16/daily6.html#:~:text=Chevy%20Chase%20put%20the%20700,KSI%20and%20Kettler%20%26%20Scott)). Meanwhile, Trump’s existing core properties (like Trump Tower in NYC and commercial buildings) saw valuation pressures in the recession but remained under his control. One significant boost to Trump’s liquidity had come just before the crisis: in 2008 he **sold his Palm Beach oceanfront mansion** (which he’d bought in 2004 for ~$41 million) to Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev for a record **$95 million** ([Palm Beach Property Trump Once Owned Is About to Sell for $140 Million - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-palm-beach-real-estate-mansion-2021-1#:~:text=Trump%20bought%20the%20land%20where,estate%20record%20at%20the%20time)). This July 2008 sale – at the peak of the market – handed Trump a massive profit and cash infusion, which proved fortuitous heading into 2009’s downturn. The $95 million sale (the highest-ever Palm Beach price at the time) closed in 2008 ([Palm Beach Property Trump Once Owned Is About to Sell for $140 Million - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-palm-beach-real-estate-mansion-2021-1#:~:text=Trump%20bought%20the%20land%20where,estate%20record%20at%20the%20time)), giving Trump liquidity that likely helped him weather the 2009 crunch in other ventures.

- **Revenue from *The Apprentice* and Branding:** Trump’s NBC reality show *The Apprentice* (and its celebrity spinoff) remained a **major income source** through 2009. Publicly, Trump often cited the show’s success; privately, his tax filings later showed that *The Apprentice* and related licensing deals became a *financial lifeline* during this era, generating substantial cash while many of his real estate businesses suffered losses ([Donald Trump Raked in $427 Million on 'the Apprentice': NYT - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-raked-in-427-million-on-the-apprentice-nyt-2020-9#:~:text=President%20Donald%20Trump%20earned%20%24427,by%20The%20New%20York%20Times)) ([Donald Trump Raked in $427 Million on 'the Apprentice': NYT - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-raked-in-427-million-on-the-apprentice-nyt-2020-9#:~:text=Trump%27s%20income%20from%20,after%20exiting%20it%20in%202015)). (According to analysis of his returns, Trump would ultimately earn **about $197 million directly from *The Apprentice*** through 2015, plus another **$230 million from endorsements and licensing deals** leveraging his TV fame ([Donald Trump Raked in $427 Million on 'the Apprentice': NYT - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-raked-in-427-million-on-the-apprentice-nyt-2020-9#:~:text=President%20Donald%20Trump%20earned%20%24427,by%20The%20New%20York%20Times)).) In the late 2000s, it’s estimated Trump was making tens of millions per year from *The Apprentice*. This steady revenue helped keep Trump Organization operations afloat and funded new investments even as banks tightened credit. For example, in 2009 Trump continued to license his name for new projects (often requiring little capital from him). However, some smaller Trump ventures launched in the boom years began to falter by 2009: **Trump Mortgage**, a mortgage brokerage he started in 2006, had collapsed by 2007; **Trump Steaks** (2007) and **Trump Vodka** (2006) had failed to gain traction and quietly disappeared from the market by 2009. These were minor side businesses, but they underscored that Trump’s core earnings in this period came largely from real estate licensing and entertainment rather than new product enterprises.

- **Failed Condo Projects and Lawsuits:** The real estate crash also triggered the failure of certain Trump-branded development projects. Notably, the **Trump International Hotel & Tower in Fort Lauderdale, FL** – a licensee project Trump agreed to in 2005 – fell apart in 2009. Trump had licensed his name to a local developer for this 24-story condo-hotel, marketing it as “the finest and most luxurious” resort with Trump’s personal involvement ([PolitiFact | Did Trump bail on building condos in Florida?](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/jul/29/tim-kaine/did-trump-bail-building-condos-florida/#:~:text=Trump%20International%20Hotel%20%26%20Tower,their%20units%20like%20hotel%20rooms)) ([PolitiFact | Did Trump bail on building condos in Florida?](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/jul/29/tim-kaine/did-trump-bail-building-condos-florida/#:~:text=When%20the%20project%20was%20unveiled,luxurious%20experience%20I%20have%20created)). Buyers put down 20% deposits on units priced $500k to $3 million. But by 2008 the developer ran out of financing, and construction stalled far past its 2007 completion target ([PolitiFact | Did Trump bail on building condos in Florida?](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/jul/29/tim-kaine/did-trump-bail-building-condos-florida/#:~:text=Units%20sold%20well%20through%202006%2C,soon%20spiraled%20out%20of%20control)) ([PolitiFact | Did Trump bail on building condos in Florida?](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/jul/29/tim-kaine/did-trump-bail-building-condos-florida/#:~:text=The%20following%20year%2C%20Trump%20began,had%20difficulty%20securing%20more%20financing)). In **2009, Trump withdrew his name from the unfinished Fort Lauderdale tower**, essentially walking away as the project failed ([PolitiFact | Did Trump bail on building condos in Florida?](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/jul/29/tim-kaine/did-trump-bail-building-condos-florida/#:~:text=By%20Ciara%20O%27Rourke%20%E2%80%A2%20January,24%2C%202025)). Without the Trump brand or funding, the project went into foreclosure with **$185 million in debt** and was left “dead” ([PolitiFact | Did Trump bail on building condos in Florida?](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/jul/29/tim-kaine/did-trump-bail-building-condos-florida/#:~:text=By%20Ciara%20O%27Rourke%20%E2%80%A2%20January,24%2C%202025)). Over 100 condo buyers lost their deposits (many life savings) and filed lawsuits accusing Trump and developers of misrepresentation ([PolitiFact | Did Trump bail on building condos in Florida?](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/jul/29/tim-kaine/did-trump-bail-building-condos-florida/#:~:text=What%20Trump%20actually%20made%20on,like%20Canada%2C%20Hawaii%20and%20Mexico)) ([PolitiFact | Did Trump bail on building condos in Florida?](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/jul/29/tim-kaine/did-trump-bail-building-condos-florida/#:~:text=One%20depositor%2C%20Naraine%20Seecharan%2C%20told,than%20100%20buyers%20filed%20lawsuits)). Trump, for his part, sued the developers as well, claiming *he* lost millions in licensing fees when the deal imploded ([PolitiFact | Did Trump bail on building condos in Florida?](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/jul/29/tim-kaine/did-trump-bail-building-condos-florida/#:~:text=CFLB%20Partnership%20bought%20the%20unfinished,lawsuits%20for%20making%20misleading%20statements)). The tangled litigation over Trump Fort Lauderdale would drag on for years, though by 2013 the property was sold off to new owners (eventually completed as the Conrad Fort Lauderdale) ([PolitiFact | Did Trump bail on building condos in Florida?](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/jul/29/tim-kaine/did-trump-bail-building-condos-florida/#:~:text=CFLB%20Partnership%20bought%20the%20unfinished,lawsuits%20for%20making%20misleading%20statements)). This episode foreshadowed legal troubles Trump would face for other failed ventures. Meanwhile, **Trump Tower Tampa**, another licensed condo high-rise announced in 2005, had already collapsed by 2008 (with developers bankrupt) – leaving Florida buyers out money and Trump in court battles over whether he merely licensed his name or had responsibility. In sum, 2009 found Trump **damage-controlling** several busted projects: he exited failing deals (sometimes amid lawsuits) to protect his brand and limit financial exposure.

- **Political Posturing Begins:** Though not yet a candidate, Trump in 2009 started to dabble in politics in ways that connected to his businesses. He switched his voter registration from Republican to unaffiliated, signaling an openness to cross-party alliances. He also began publicly criticizing President Obama and promoting the false “birther” conspiracy by 2009-2010. These moves kept Trump in the media (potentially boosting *Apprentice* ratings and his personal brand). There were also hints of political aspirations: that year Trump spoke at CPAC (Conservative Political Action Conference) and increased donations to Republican candidates – actions that would lay groundwork for a possible run. While these political forays did not yet directly alter Trump’s finances, they **elevated his public profile**, indirectly sustaining the celebrity aura that underpinned his licensing and entertainment income.

## 2010: Settlements, Name Changes, and Stabilizing Finances

- **Settling Major Debts and Lawsuits:** In 2010, Trump moved past the worst of the financial crisis by finalizing settlements and restructuring deals that had begun in 2009. The **Chicago tower loan dispute was resolved**, with Deutsche Bank and other lenders agreeing to extend deadlines and forgive a large portion of the debt (as noted, roughly $270 million was wiped out) ([President Trump had $270 million in debt on Chicago's Trump Tower forgiven: New York Times | FOX 32 Chicago](https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/president-trump-had-270-million-in-debt-on-chicagos-trump-tower-forgiven-new-york-times#:~:text=Trump%20%20owed%20them)) ([President Trump had $270 million in debt on Chicago's Trump Tower forgiven: New York Times | FOX 32 Chicago](https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/president-trump-had-270-million-in-debt-on-chicagos-trump-tower-forgiven-new-york-times#:~:text=forgave%20at%20least%20%24287%20million,bank%20of%20the%20Chicago%20River)). This allowed Trump to avoid foreclosure on one of his most prized assets. With the debt reduced, Trump’s company was able to continue operating the Chicago skyscraper, and by mid-2010 the hotel-condo tower was completed and opened to the public. Similarly, Trump’s **casino bankruptcy plan took effect in 2010**: he emerged with a minority stake and no operational role in the Atlantic City properties, meaning their debts were off his books. These restructurings significantly improved Trump’s personal balance sheet. In fact, by late 2010 Trump was reportedly considering buying back into the casinos if conditions improved, but he ultimately did not (leaving them to future bankruptcies under different owners). 

- **Trump University Controversy:** One of Trump’s more contentious business ventures – **Trump University**, a for-profit real estate seminar program launched in 2005 – ran into legal trouble in 2010. The New York State Education Department determined that “Trump University” was not a licensed educational institution and was **operating illegally under that name**. In May 2010, under pressure from regulators, Trump University **changed its name to “The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative”** to remove the word “University” ([Trump's Defense of His 'University' - FactCheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2016/03/trumps-defense-of-his-university/#:~:text=Trump%20and%20his%20%E2%80%9Cuniversity%2C%E2%80%9D%20which,courses%20and%20are%20seeking%20reimbursement)). Despite the rebranding, complaints from former students (who paid tens of thousands for mentorship workshops) were mounting. While major lawsuits (including a $40 million fraud suit by NY Attorney General Eric Schneiderman) would be filed in 2013, the groundwork was laid in 2010-2012 with investigations into deceptive practices ([Trump's Defense of His 'University' - FactCheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2016/03/trumps-defense-of-his-university/#:~:text=Trump%20and%20his%20%E2%80%9Cuniversity%2C%E2%80%9D%20which,courses%20and%20are%20seeking%20reimbursement)) ([Trump's Defense of His 'University' - FactCheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2016/03/trumps-defense-of-his-university/#:~:text=2010%2C%20are%20the%20subjects%20of,courses%20and%20are%20seeking%20reimbursement)). Trump vigorously defended the program in the press, but the name change signaled an acknowledgment of regulatory violations. Financially, Trump University/Entrepreneur Initiative was winding down by 2010 – it stopped enrolling new students and essentially ceased operations amid the scrutiny. This was a preventive legal move, but it also meant the end of whatever revenue stream the venture had provided (reportedly around $40 million gross over its lifetime, though much was spent on marketing and instructors).

- **New York Real Estate and Refinancing:** Trump’s core New York properties saw some recovery in 2010 as the real estate market slowly rebounded. Occupancy and rental rates at **Trump Tower (725 Fifth Avenue)** and the commercial buildings in his portfolio began improving. Critically, in 2010 Trump was preparing for a major refinance of Trump Tower’s debt. He had a large mortgage coming due on the building (where he owned the office/retail condo portion). To position himself for favorable terms, Trump needed solid financials. Documents later revealed that in **2010–2011 Trump’s company reported higher occupancy figures to lenders than to tax authorities**, apparently to appear more creditworthy ([Trump Tax Records Reveal New Inconsistencies — This Time for Trump Tower — ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-trump-tower-tax-records-reveal-new-inconsistencies#:~:text=In%20the%20latest%20case%2C%20the,city%20tax%20officials%2C%20records%20show)) ([Trump Tax Records Reveal New Inconsistencies — This Time for Trump Tower — ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-trump-tower-tax-records-reveal-new-inconsistencies#:~:text=Trump%20had%20much%20to%20gain,million%20loan%20on%20favorable%20terms)). (For example, at the end of 2010 Trump Org told lenders Trump Tower’s commercial space was >95% leased, when tax filings showed only ~83% occupied ([Trump Tax Records Reveal New Inconsistencies — This Time for Trump Tower — ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-trump-tower-tax-records-reveal-new-inconsistencies#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20as%20of%20December,%E2%80%9Cborrower%20financials%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20prospectus%20stated)).) By **mid-2012, Trump successfully refinanced Trump Tower with a new **$100 million** loan on favorable terms ([Trump Tax Records Reveal New Inconsistencies — This Time for Trump Tower — ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-trump-tower-tax-records-reveal-new-inconsistencies#:~:text=Trump%20had%20much%20to%20gain,million%20loan%20on%20favorable%20terms)). This refinancing – which was likely being negotiated in 2010–11 – **reduced Trump’s interest costs and freed up cash**. It exemplified how Trump used the post-crisis low interest rate environment to **restructure debt** on flagship assets. Similarly, Trump’s 40 Wall Street office building had a large loan that was refinanced around this period (eventually with Ladder Capital in 2012). These maneuvers improved Trump’s liquidity and provided capital for new projects by leveraging the equity in his stabilized New York real estate.

- **Trump SoHo Opening and Litigation:** In Spring 2010, the **Trump SoHo** hotel-condominium in Manhattan opened its doors. This project – a 46-story luxury tower in SoHo – was developed by Bayrock Group and partners, with Trump licensing his name and handling management. The building’s debut was a high-profile expansion of the Trump brand in New York during 2010. **Sales of the condo units were slow**, however, due to the recession’s aftermath. In fact, only about one-third of units had sold by 2011, despite marketing that implied much higher sales. This led to a group of buyers suing in 2011, accusing the Trump Organization and partners of fraudulently overstating sales figures to induce purchases. The lawsuit claimed that promotional materials (and even Ivanka Trump’s statements) misrepresented the building as “30%, 40%, 60% sold” when the real number was far lower ([Occupy Spring St.: Trump SoHo to give 90% refunds on deposits](https://nypost.com/2011/11/03/occupy-spring-st-trump-soho-to-give-90-refunds-on-deposits/#:~:text=Occupy%20Spring%20St,fact%20only%2016%20percent)) ([New York business fraud lawsuit against the Trump Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_business_fraud_lawsuit_against_the_Trump_Organization#:~:text=New%20York%20business%20fraud%20lawsuit,gains%2C%20among%20other%20penalties)). In **November 2011, Trump’s team settled the SoHo lawsuit** out of court. The settlement refunded *90% of the deposit money* (about $3.16 million total) to the disgruntled buyers, though the defendants admitted no wrongdoing ([Donald Trump Settled a Real Estate Lawsuit](https://alblawfirm.com/press-mentions/donaldtrumplawsuit/#:~:text=He%20and%20his%20co,deposits%2C%20while%20admitting%20no)) ([Adam Leitman Bailey, P.C. Prevails Against Trump Soho on Fraud ...](https://alblawfirm.com/case-studies/trump-soho/#:~:text=,refund%20on%20their%20deposits)). This quiet resolution – repaying buyers roughly $2.8 million – averted a protracted fraud trial that could have harmed the Trump brand. Trump SoHo’s operations continued, but the incident was a **notable legal dispute** intersecting with finances: had it gone to trial, Trump risked financial penalties and damaging revelations. Instead, by refunding deposits, Trump essentially paid to make the problem go away, preserving the project’s reputation (and his children Ivanka and Don Jr., who had been involved in marketing, from further legal jeopardy ([Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Knew 'Ten Thousand Percent' They ...](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-jr-ivanka-knew-ten-thousand-percent-they-were-defrauding-buyers-trump-soho-1481304#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%20Jr,16%20million%20in%20deposits))). Notably, the Manhattan District Attorney’s office had been investigating the same issue; after the civil settlement, no criminal charges were filed. For Trump, resolving this in 2011 cleared a potential hurdle before his anticipated political foray in 2012.

- **Television and Licensing Income Peak:** By 2010–2011, *The Apprentice* (now **Celebrity Apprentice** in its later seasons) was still going strong on NBC. These years likely **marked the peak of Trump’s earnings from the show and related licensing**. An analysis by The New York Times found that **2011 was a high-water mark, with Trump earning about $51 million that year from *The Apprentice* and associated licensing deals** ([Donald Trump Raked in $427 Million on 'the Apprentice': NYT - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-raked-in-427-million-on-the-apprentice-nyt-2020-9#:~:text=%2A%20Trump%27s%20income%20from%20,fake%20news)). (After 2011, his TV-related income would begin to decline as ratings softened and fewer new licensing deals came online ([Donald Trump Raked in $427 Million on 'the Apprentice': NYT - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-raked-in-427-million-on-the-apprentice-nyt-2020-9#:~:text=%2A%20Trump%27s%20income%20from%20,fake%20news)).) The importance of this cannot be overstated: that ~$50 million in 2011 provided cash for Trump’s new acquisitions (like golf resorts and wineries) and helped service debt. Indeed, **Trump’s surge in property acquisitions in 2011–2012 was bankrolled in part by his TV/persona income** ([Donald Trump Raked in $427 Million on 'the Apprentice': NYT - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-raked-in-427-million-on-the-apprentice-nyt-2020-9#:~:text=Trump%27s%20income%20from%20,after%20exiting%20it%20in%202015)) ([Donald Trump Raked in $427 Million on 'the Apprentice': NYT - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-raked-in-427-million-on-the-apprentice-nyt-2020-9#:~:text=President%20Donald%20Trump%20earned%20%24427,by%20The%20New%20York%20Times)). The *Times* reported that the show’s money “turned out to be a financial lifeline” that propped up Trump’s other businesses which were often losing money ([Donald Trump Raked in $427 Million on 'the Apprentice': NYT - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-raked-in-427-million-on-the-apprentice-nyt-2020-9#:~:text=President%20Donald%20Trump%20earned%20%24427,by%20The%20New%20York%20Times)). Essentially, the reality TV fame was converted into real assets on Trump’s balance sheet around this time. In addition to *Apprentice* earnings, **Trump scored lucrative branding deals in 2010–2011**: for example, he licensed his name to new international projects (in places like **Turkey** and **Latin America** – deals that would culminate in openings by 2012, discussed below). These required little capital from Trump but offered millions in fees. One such deal signed in 2010 was **Trump Towers Istanbul**, a two-tower complex developed by Turkey’s Doğan Group, which agreed to pay Trump Organization royalties for the use of the name.

- **Political Intersection – Testing the Waters:** 2010 set the stage for Trump’s more overt entry into politics. He increased his appearances at political events and on talk shows discussing policy. In early 2011 (technically beyond 2010, but part of the same trend), Trump gained enormous publicity by loudly considering a run for President in 2012. Behind the scenes in late 2010, he commissioned polls and made visits to early primary states. This political posturing had a side benefit: **NBC reportedly pressured Trump for an answer on the next season of *Celebrity Apprentice*, eventually offering a higher salary to keep him, as Trump leveraged the possibility of a presidential run** (as later reported by insiders). Thus, Trump’s political flirtation in 2010–2011 may have directly influenced his finances – e.g. *The Apprentice* pay. Additionally, being in the political spotlight enhanced the **Trump brand’s visibility**, arguably boosting demand for Trump-branded projects and products globally. In short, politics and business began to mix: Trump’s public political statements were partly *marketing*, and his business empire benefited from the heightened fame.

## 2011: New Ventures and Increasing Public Profile

- **Acquisition of Trump Winery (Kluge Estate):** In April 2011, Trump expanded into the wine business by purchasing **Kluge Estate Winery and Vineyard** near Charlottesville, Virginia. The upscale winery – 800 acres with vineyards and a lavish tasting room – had fallen into foreclosure after its previous owner, socialite Patricia Kluge, defaulted on $23 million owed to Bank of America ([Donald Trump buys Kluge winery - Decanter](https://www.decanter.com/wine-news/trump-buys-kluge-winery-40383/#:~:text=Chelsea%20Clinton%E2%80%99s%20wedding%20in%202010,sent%20the%20winery%20into%20difficulties)) ([Donald Trump buys Kluge winery - Decanter](https://www.decanter.com/wine-news/trump-buys-kluge-winery-40383/#:~:text=By%20February%20this%20year%20Kluge,26m)). Trump swooped in at a bankruptcy auction and **bought the property for a mere $6.2 million** ([Donald Trump buys Kluge winery - Decanter](https://www.decanter.com/wine-news/trump-buys-kluge-winery-40383/#:~:text=Real%20estate%20mogul%20Donald%20Trump,2m%2C%20according%20to%20reports)) ([Donald Trump buys Kluge winery - Decanter](https://www.decanter.com/wine-news/trump-buys-kluge-winery-40383/#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%20%E2%80%93%20a%20candidate,staff%20to%20run%20the%20operation)), a fraction of its investment cost. “I’m really interested in good real estate, not so much in wine,” Trump told the press, explaining he saw it as a real estate bargain ([Donald Trump buys Kluge winery - Decanter](https://www.decanter.com/wine-news/trump-buys-kluge-winery-40383/#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%20%E2%80%93%20a%20candidate,staff%20to%20run%20the%20operation)). He kept Kluge on as a consultant (“She has a great instinct for wine,” Trump said ([Donald Trump buys Kluge winery - Decanter](https://www.decanter.com/wine-news/trump-buys-kluge-winery-40383/#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%20%E2%80%93%20a%20candidate,staff%20to%20run%20the%20operation))) and rebranded the business as **Trump Winery**. By late 2011, bottles labeled “Trump” were on sale and the winery was being integrated into Trump’s portfolio (managed by his son Eric Trump). The purchase included the vineyard, winery facilities, and the 45-room Albemarle mansion (which Trump bought separately in 2011 for about $6.5 million in another foreclosure sale) – all acquired at fire-sale prices ([Trump Buys Kluge Estate and Winery - Charlottesville UnCorked](https://charlottesvilleuncorked.com/2011/04/07/trump-buys-kluge-estate-and-winery/#:~:text=UnCorked%20charlottesvilleuncorked,2%20million%20dollars)) ([Donald Trump buys Kluge winery - Decanter](https://www.decanter.com/wine-news/trump-buys-kluge-winery-40383/#:~:text=Real%20estate%20mogul%20Donald%20Trump,2m%2C%20according%20to%20reports)). This venture diversifed Trump’s assets (adding valuable land and a luxury hospitality arm) at minimal cost. It also provided a new revenue stream from wine sales and event rentals, although Trump later claimed (in FEC disclosures) that the winery mostly broke even. Importantly, Trump’s ability to pay cash for distressed assets like Kluge Estate in 2011 underscored his improved liquidity, thanks in part to the debt forgiveness and TV income discussed above.

- **Exploring a Presidential Run:** 2011 was the year Trump very publicly explored running for president, a move with both political and business ramifications. In spring 2011, Trump made headlines questioning President Obama’s birthplace, a **media blitz that kept him in the news constantly**. By May, Obama released his long-form birth certificate, and Trump claimed credit for the outcome. During this period, Trump’s **poll numbers among Republican primary voters spiked**, and he was arguably one of the best-known “candidates” – despite not formally declaring. In terms of finance, this political flirtation had side effects: Trump had to disclose some personal financial information to legitimize his potential candidacy. He claimed in early 2011 that his net worth was over $7 billion (with minimal debt), though independent analysts like Forbes pegged it much lower. He also stated he was willing to spend $600 million of his own money if he ran (suggesting significant liquidity, though skeptics questioned if that was true). Ultimately, in May 2011 Trump **announced he would *not* run for president** and renewed his contract with NBC for *Celebrity Apprentice*. Many observers believed that Trump’s high-profile “pseudo-campaign” was a **negotiating tactic** to secure a better TV deal – indeed, *The Apprentice* continued on air, and as noted, 2011 ended up being a peak earnings year for Trump from NBC ([Donald Trump Raked in $427 Million on 'the Apprentice': NYT - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-raked-in-427-million-on-the-apprentice-nyt-2020-9#:~:text=%2A%20Trump%27s%20income%20from%20,fake%20news)). Politically, Trump’s actions in 2011 cemented his base in the conservative audience, which bolstered the Trump brand among a segment of the population even as it alienated others. From a business perspective, his increased fame led to more opportunities: for example, **speaking engagements** (he was reportedly able to charge hefty fees for appearances by 2012) and **book sales** (his 2011 book *Time to Get Tough* capitalized on his political persona).

- **International Licensing Expansions:** Trump’s organization signed and launched multiple international real estate projects around 2011, leveraging his brand’s global appeal. One major project was **Trump Ocean Club International Hotel & Tower in Panama City**, a 70-story sail-shaped skyscraper. This was a licensing and management deal – Trump did not build it, but the tower carried his name. It **officially opened in July 2011**, becoming the tallest building in Latin America at the time. Trump attended the opening, touting it as “one of the finest buildings in the world.” Financially, the developers paid Trump millions in licensing fees and gave the Trump Organization a management contract to operate the hotel portion. While exact figures are private, later court cases indicated Trump’s cut could be on the order of **$ management fees per condo sale and a percentage of revenue** (when the partnership soured years later, these contracts became an issue). Nonetheless, in 2011 the Panama project’s completion was a **brand win** and added to Trump’s income streams (through ongoing fees). 

  Around the same time, construction was wrapping up on **Trump International Hotel & Tower Toronto** in Canada. This $500 million, 65-story hotel-condo tower (developed by Talon International) had been in development since 2007. It faced delays due to the recession, but by **early 2012 the Trump Toronto tower was finished and in partial operation** ([The St. Regis Toronto - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_St._Regis_Toronto#:~:text=The%20St.%20Regis%20Toronto%20,Work%20on%20the)). Its formal grand opening took place in April 2012 with Donald Trump and his children in attendance ([43 Trump International Hotel And Tower Toronto Grand Opening ...](https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/trump-international-hotel-and-tower-toronto-grand-opening-ribbon-cutting-ceremony#:~:text=,April%2016%2C%202012%20in%20Toronto)). Trump had licensed his name and agreed to manage the property in exchange for fees; he did not invest equity. Although many units remained unsold (and the project would later struggle financially), at opening the developer praised it as the most luxurious building in Canada. For Trump, Toronto’s launch meant additional branding fees and a foothold in the Canadian market.

  Another significant international deal was **Trump Towers Istanbul** in Turkey. This project comprised two conjoined towers (one office, one residential) in Istanbul’s Şişli district – notable as **Trump’s first project in Europe**. The towers were completed and inaugurated in **April 2012**, with a high-profile opening ceremony. Turkey’s Prime Minister at the time, **Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, attended the opening**, and Donald Trump used the occasion to lavish praise on Erdoğan as a leader “highly respected all over the world” ([Behind Trump-Erdogan 'bromance,' a White House meeting to repair U.S.-Turkey ties | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/behind-trump-erdogan-bromance-a-white-house-meeting-to-repair-us-turkey-tie-idUSKBN1XM0EZ/#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2FANKARA%20%28Reuters%29%20,around%20the%20world)) ([Behind Trump-Erdogan 'bromance,' a White House meeting to repair U.S.-Turkey ties | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/behind-trump-erdogan-bromance-a-white-house-meeting-to-repair-us-turkey-tie-idUSKBN1XM0EZ/#:~:text=mostly%20Turkish%20audience%20that%20their,around%20the%20world)). This underscored a **political-business intersection**: Trump publicly flattered a sitting head of government, likely to solidify their relationship, while Erdoğan’s presence lent prestige to Trump’s project. Ivanka Trump even tweeted “Thank you Prime Minister Erdoğan for joining us” at the launch ([Ivanka Tweet Thanking Turkey's Erdogan for Trump Towers Launch ...](https://www.newsweek.com/ivanka-trump-tweet-thanking-turkey-erdogan-attending-istanbul-trump-towers-launch-syria-controversy-1463536#:~:text=Ivanka%20Tweet%20Thanking%20Turkey%27s%20Erdogan,The)). Under the licensing agreement, Trump received an estimated **$5 million+ fee** for the use of his name on the Istanbul towers, plus a percentage of condo sales. By partnering with Turkish developer Doğan Holding, Trump incurred no construction cost but enjoys ongoing royalties. However, the close association with a foreign leader hinted at future conflicts – indeed in later years Erdoğan and Trump would have a direct line of communication, and critics pointed to the Istanbul project as a source of potential **foreign influence on Trump’s finances**. In 2012, though, it was simply a lucrative deal and another international trophy for the Trump brand.

- **Scottish Golf Resort Completion:** Trump’s long-running golf resort project in Scotland came to fruition in 2012. After years of planning and political wrangling, the **Trump International Golf Links Scotland** opened in July 2012 near Aberdeen. Trump had acquired the vast dunesland in 2006 and, despite fierce opposition from environmental groups and an initial rejection by local authorities, he eventually won approval when the Scottish government intervened in 2008 to overturn the local decision ([In Scotland, Trump Built a Wall. Then He Sent Residents the Bill.](https://www.barbrastreisand.com/news/scotland-trump-built-wall-sent-residents-bill/#:~:text=Bill,2008%2C%20overruling%20local%20officials%2C)). Scotland’s First Minister at the time, Alex Salmond, personally championed the project for its potential economic benefits ([In Scotland, Trump Built a Wall. Then He Sent Residents the Bill.](https://www.barbrastreisand.com/news/scotland-trump-built-wall-sent-residents-bill/#:~:text=Bill,2008%2C%20overruling%20local%20officials%2C)). By 2012, Trump had poured an estimated £100 million into developing the championship links course (and a temporary clubhouse; planned hotel and housing phases were to follow). The course’s opening was a personal triumph for Trump, who declared it “the greatest golf course in the world.” However, almost immediately Trump’s business interests collided with public policy: he objected to an offshore **wind farm proposal** in Aberdeen Bay that would be visible from the golf links. In **April 2012, Trump testified before the Scottish Parliament** in an attempt to block the wind farm, arguing the turbines would ruin the coastline and his resort’s vistas ([Trump's boasts draw laughs in Scottish parliament - CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trumps-boasts-draw-laughs-in-scottish-parliament/#:~:text=Trump%27s%20boasts%20draw%20laughs%20in,fears%20will%20spoil%20the%20view)). He sparred with Scottish lawmakers (at one point his boasts during testimony drew laughter) and launched a legal challenge against the wind farm. This high-profile fight – essentially Trump using political channels to protect a business investment – showed the **intersection of politics, renewable energy policy, and Trump’s finances**. (Trump ultimately lost: the wind farm was approved and his court appeals failed by 2015 ([Trump tweeted about Scottish wind farm 60 times - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/trump-scottish-wind-farms-231741#:~:text=Offline%2C%20Trump%20took%20his%20opposition,rejected%20his%20case%20in%202015)).) Despite that battle, the Scottish golf course began operations in 2012 and started generating revenue from wealthy golfers drawn by the Trump name. Trump’s investment in Scotland was a long-term play; initially the resort operated at a loss, but land value and prestige were the returns he touted. The Scotland saga illustrated Trump’s style of doing business: courting politicians to get his way (Salmond in 2008) and later confronting politicians when his interests were threatened (Scottish Parliament in 2012).

- **Personal Liquidity Moves:** By the end of 2011, Trump’s personal finances were on more solid footing than a few years prior. He had converted a lot of debt into equity (or had it forgiven) and had significant cash inflows from *The Apprentice*, the Palm Beach sale, and asset refinances. Trump signaled this financial strength through some conspicuous purchases: aside from the winery and Doral (purchased in 2012, see below), he also bought luxury vehicles (he added a new private **Cessna Citation X** jet to his fleet around 2011) and continued owning his Boeing 727 and Sikorsky helicopter emblazoned with “Trump”. He also made a high-profile **purchase of a stake in the Avenue of the Americas building in New York** (actually this was a 30% partnership interest he had since 2007 in 1290 Avenue and 555 California via Vornado Realty Trust – which he held onto). No major personal asset sales occurred in 2011 aside from those distressed deals he’d picked up. If anything, Trump was in acquisition mode, not selling mode, thanks to restored liquidity. One noteworthy sale: in 2011 the owners of the **Sentinel Building in Chicago (the clock-tower building adjacent to Trump Tower)** sold it, and Trump was *rumored* to be interested, but he did not end up purchasing it. Instead, he focused capital on the projects above. By 2012, **Forbes estimated Trump’s net worth** at around $2.9–3.1 billion (up from roughly $2 billion in 2009), reflecting the rebound in real estate values and Trump’s successful maneuvers during the recovery.

## 2012: Major Acquisitions and a Pivotal Year

- **Purchase of Doral Golf Resort:** 2012 was marked by one of Trump’s biggest acquisitions to date – the **Doral Golf Resort & Spa** in Miami. In February 2012, Trump’s company won the bankruptcy auction to buy the famed Doral Resort for **$150 million** ([Trump buys Miami’s Doral resort, kicks out Marriott - Tampa Bay Business Journal](https://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/blog/morning-edition/2012/02/trump-buys-miamis-doral-resort-kicks.html#:~:text=Real%20estate%20developer%20and%20television,golf%20resort%20out%20of%20bankruptcy)). The Doral was a legendary 800-acre golf property with four courses (including the Blue Monster, a PGA Tour stop) and a 700-room hotel. It had fallen into bankruptcy under previous owners, presenting a prime opportunity. Trump beat out several bidders and sealed the deal, announcing ambitious plans: he would invest another **$150 million in renovations** to restore Doral to “its former glory” ([Trump buys Miami’s Doral resort, kicks out Marriott - Tampa Bay Business Journal](https://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/blog/morning-edition/2012/02/trump-buys-miamis-doral-resort-kicks.html#:~:text=The%20deal%20is%20worth%20%24150,according%20to%20the%20Miami%20Herald)) ([Trump buys Miami’s Doral resort, kicks out Marriott - Tampa Bay Business Journal](https://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/blog/morning-edition/2012/02/trump-buys-miamis-doral-resort-kicks.html#:~:text=Trump%20said%20he%20will%20spend,room%20hotel%20and%20resort)). As part of the purchase, Trump **ousted Marriott** – which had been managing the resort – so that the Trump Organization could take over all operations directly ([Trump buys Miami’s Doral resort, kicks out Marriott - Tampa Bay Business Journal](https://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/blog/morning-edition/2012/02/trump-buys-miamis-doral-resort-kicks.html#:~:text=Trump%20said%20he%20will%20spend,room%20hotel%20and%20resort)). The deal instantly expanded Trump’s golf portfolio (adding to courses he owned in New York, New Jersey, Scotland, and the one acquired in 2009 near D.C.). Trump touted the property’s potential, noting “it would be impossible for a developer today to replicate a property of this size in Miami” and calling Doral irreplaceable ([Trump buys Miami's Doral golf resort for $150 million | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/americas/trump-buys-miamis-doral-golf-resort-for-150-million-idUSTRE81R1C7/#:~:text=Trump%20announced%20the%20deal%20on,courses%2C%20including%20the%20Blue%20Monster)) ([Trump buys Miami's Doral golf resort for $150 million | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/americas/trump-buys-miamis-doral-golf-resort-for-150-million-idUSTRE81R1C7/#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20the%20purchase,golf%20course%20architect%20Gil%20Hanse)). Importantly, there was a **political dimension** to the Doral purchase: at the time Trump emerged as a bidder, Florida was debating legislation to allow major casino resorts. If Florida had approved casino gaming at resorts, Doral’s value could skyrocket as a possible casino site. Trump openly acknowledged this upside, saying he’d consider a casino at Doral if laws changed. In early 2012, the casino bill was shelved, but observers noted that **Trump’s positioning in Miami could pay off down the road if gambling was legalized** ([Trump buys Miami's Doral golf resort for $150 million | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/americas/trump-buys-miamis-doral-golf-resort-for-150-million-idUSTRE81R1C7/#:~:text=When%20Trump%20first%20emerged%20as,Miami%20and%20Fort%20Lauderdale%20area)). The Doral acquisition demonstrated Trump’s renewed *buying power* – putting $150 million on the table – which likely came from a combination of the Trump Tower refinance ($100 million loan secured in 2012) ([Trump Tax Records Reveal New Inconsistencies — This Time for Trump Tower — ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-trump-tower-tax-records-reveal-new-inconsistencies#:~:text=Trump%20had%20much%20to%20gain,million%20loan%20on%20favorable%20terms)), cash from the Palm Beach sale, and *Apprentice*-generated profits. By June 2012 the sale closed, and Trump’s team took charge of Doral’s operations, beginning a sweeping renovation of the hotel, courses, and facilities.

- **Continued Branding Deals and Openings:** Beyond Doral, 2012 saw the fruition of the international projects mentioned: **Trump Tower Toronto** opened (January/April 2012), **Trump Towers Istanbul** opened (April 2012, with Erdoğan present) ([Behind Trump-Erdogan 'bromance,' a White House meeting to repair U.S.-Turkey ties | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/behind-trump-erdogan-bromance-a-white-house-meeting-to-repair-us-turkey-tie-idUSKBN1XM0EZ/#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2FANKARA%20%28Reuters%29%20,around%20the%20world)), and **Trump’s Panama tower was in full operation** (after its mid-2011 opening). Trump’s organization also announced new deals in 2012: one example, in late April 2012, Donald Trump traveled to the country of **Georgia (former Soviet republic)** to unveil a planned **Trump Tower in Batumi** on the Black Sea. There, alongside Georgian President **Mikheil Saakashvili**, Trump announced a licensing agreement to put his name on a 47-story luxury condo tower to be developed by the Silk Road Group ([Saakashvili, Trump Unveil Tower Project, Praise Each Other – Civil Georgia](https://civil.ge/archives/121876#:~:text=President%20Saakashvili%20and%20American%20property,Trump%20has%20lent%20his%20name)) ([Saakashvili, Trump Unveil Tower Project, Praise Each Other – Civil Georgia](https://civil.ge/archives/121876#:~:text=Construction%20of%20the%20Trump%20Tower,mark%20under%20a%20license%20deal)). Trump hailed Saakashvili’s leadership and was even awarded a Georgian state medal during his visit ([Saakashvili, Trump Unveil Tower Project, Praise Each Other – Civil Georgia](https://civil.ge/archives/121876#:~:text=,to%20Georgia%20on%20April%2021)). While Trump Tower Batumi was never ultimately built (the project was put on hold and eventually canceled by 2017), the 2012 announcement exemplified Trump’s aggressive global expansion strategy during this period. He leveraged personal relationships with foreign leaders to secure deals – in Georgia’s case, a PR event with the president to instill confidence. Financially, these new licensing ventures promised future income with minimal outlay. Trump’s company likely received upfront fees for such branding agreements in 2012, boosting short-term revenue. The risk, of course, was partnering in unstable markets (as Batumi showed). Nonetheless, by end of 2012, Trump had a presence (built or planned) in **North America, South America, Europe, and Asia** via these deals – setting the stage for the Trump Organization’s international footprint.

- **Ongoing Legal Matters:** While 2012 was relatively quiet on new lawsuits, some earlier disputes continued. The fallout from the failed Fort Lauderdale tower was still in the courts – though Trump had largely extricated himself by claiming he was merely a licensor with no responsibility. In 2012 a **Florida appeals court** heard arguments in the Fort Lauderdale buyers’ lawsuits (which alleged Trump misrepresented his role) ([Inside Donald Trump's Ugly, Litigious History in Florida](https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/inside-donald-trumps-ugly-litigious-history-in-florida-8837810#:~:text=Inside%20Donald%20Trump%27s%20Ugly%2C%20Litigious,in%20the%20past%2030%20years)). Trump’s side argued that contracts explicitly noted he was not the developer. Indeed, by 2014, Trump would be *cleared of personal liability* in that case, but in 2012 it remained unresolved. In Atlantic City, Trump’s name licensing on the casinos occasionally drew him into disputes; for instance, in late 2012 there were rumblings that Trump might sue Trump Entertainment (in which he held 10%) if they didn’t maintain the properties well (foreshadowing a 2014 suit to remove his name due to dilapidation). On the personal front, Trump in 2012 settled a minor lawsuit with a **pro baseball player, JD Drew**, over deposit forfeiture on a Trump Florida condo (the buyer backed out; Trump kept the deposit; Drew sued; it quietly settled). Overall, 2012’s legal landscape for Trump was dominated by *management* of existing issues rather than new ones – a calm before the storm given that in 2013 the high-profile Trump University fraud suit and other cases would erupt.

- **Financial Summary by 2012:** By the close of 2012, **Donald Trump’s financial position had markedly improved from the post-crisis low of 2009**. He had acquired marquee assets like Doral and a winery, completed trophy developments via licensing deals (strengthening his brand equity), and slashed debt through favorable settlements. His personal income was bolstered by *The Apprentice* (though 2012 would be the final year near peak earnings – the show’s revenue to Trump in 2012 was still in the tens of millions ([Donald Trump Raked in $427 Million on 'the Apprentice': NYT - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-raked-in-427-million-on-the-apprentice-nyt-2020-9#:~:text=%2A%20Trump%27s%20income%20from%20,fake%20news))). According to Trump’s representatives, his **personal liquidity was strong enough to fund a presidential campaign** if he had chosen to run in 2012 – an indication that he had significant cash or easily liquidatable assets by that point. While exact figures are not public, Trump’s extensive use of leverage means we can infer from known deals: for example, the $100 million Trump Tower loan (2012) ([Trump Tax Records Reveal New Inconsistencies — This Time for Trump Tower — ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-trump-tower-tax-records-reveal-new-inconsistencies#:~:text=Trump%20had%20much%20to%20gain,million%20loan%20on%20favorable%20terms)) may have partially financed the $150 million Doral purchase (2012) ([Trump buys Miami’s Doral resort, kicks out Marriott - Tampa Bay Business Journal](https://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/blog/morning-edition/2012/02/trump-buys-miamis-doral-resort-kicks.html#:~:text=Real%20estate%20developer%20and%20television,golf%20resort%20out%20of%20bankruptcy)), essentially converting equity in one asset into a new asset. **Forbes** in 2012 estimated Trump’s net worth at roughly $3 billion, up from ~$2.4 billion in 2010, thanks to rising real estate values and acquisitions. Trump himself, gearing up for another possible run (for NY Governor in 2014 or President in 2016), began to brag more insistently that his net worth was “over $7 billion” (a figure not corroborated by independent analysis). He also claimed in late 2012 that the **Trump Organization’s revenues were the highest ever**, citing booming business at his golf resorts and hotels. Public filings for certain Trump entities (e.g., his publicly traded casino company, though he was mostly out of it by then) were limited, but **tax records obtained later showed that from 2011 onward, Trump was reporting huge business losses that offset most of his income** ([IRS Audit Could Cost Trump $100 Million — ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-irs-audit-chicago-hotel-taxes#:~:text=those%20from%202011%20to%202017,The%20revisions)) ([IRS Audit Could Cost Trump $100 Million — ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-irs-audit-chicago-hotel-taxes#:~:text=from%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Apprentice%E2%80%9D%20and%20agreements,The%20revisions)). Specifically, from 2011 to 2014 he reported positive income (about $184 million from *The Apprentice* and licensing in those years) but also claimed **large tax losses**, possibly from depreciation and the debt forgiveness deals, resulting in minimal income tax paid ([IRS Audit Could Cost Trump $100 Million — ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-irs-audit-chicago-hotel-taxes#:~:text=those%20from%202011%20to%202017,The%20revisions)). This suggests that even as Trump’s *asset* values grew, his *taxable income* remained low due to carryover losses – a complex but deliberate strategy to minimize taxes while still enjoying cash flow.

- **Intersections of Business and Politics:** 2012 was also the year Trump fully re-entered politics as a kingmaker rather than candidate. In **February 2012, Trump endorsed Mitt Romney for President** at a Las Vegas event (famously, with glitzy Trump Hotel signage as backdrop). By doing so, Trump kept himself in the political conversation and likely curried favor with the Republican establishment. (Emails later showed the Romney campaign had wooed Trump for the endorsement, reflecting Trump’s perceived influence with a certain base.) This intersection had subtle business implications: for instance, Trump’s endorsement presser was held at his **Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas**, giving free publicity to that property. Also, around that time the **Nevada caucus** was held in Trump’s hotel ballroom, again blending politics and business promotion. Additionally, Trump’s **friends-turned-political-allies** were emerging – one example: **Steven Mnuchin** (whose fund forgave Trump’s Chicago loan) and **Stephen Schwarzman** (Blackstone CEO, whom Trump courted) were now Romney supporters too, linking Trump’s financial world with GOP politics. In essence, Trump was networking in ways that could benefit his business down the line. Another instance was Florida’s governor and legislators: Trump donated to key Florida Republicans in 2012, while concurrently acquiring Doral and eyeing that casino legislation. Such contributions and endorsements could engender goodwill that might help his businesses (for example, Florida regulators in 2013 granted Trump a coveted gambling license for a small stake he held in a casino boat, even as full casino gaming at Doral remained illegal). These are nuanced points, but they illustrate how from 2009–2012 Trump increasingly navigated the overlap of the political arena and his financial interests.

Throughout 2009–2012, Donald Trump managed to turn a post-recession slump into a period of significant growth for his empire, thanks to savvy deal-making (and debt shedding), the steady inflow of reality TV cash, and an opportunistic expansion into distressed assets and global licensing. By 2012, these efforts positioned him for the larger political and business ventures that would follow in the subsequent years.
