Donald J. Trump’s rise in New York (1977–1990) was entangled with a web of figures spanning organized crime, Cold War intelligence, and international finance. This investigation examines **all key individuals (excluding Trump himself) and events** referenced in the DJT Chapter 2 timeline, expanding on their roles, connections, and influence. Using the DJT “Manchurian Candidate” framework – which posits potential foreign influence via **financial entanglements, covert communications, and intelligence monitoring** – we analyze how each person or incident might fit into a larger pattern. We draw on declassified intelligence files, court records, news archives, and expert reporting to ensure all findings are factual and well-documented. Key indicators such as unusual money flows, espionage contacts, and policy alignments are identified for each individual. We also consider alternative, more innocuous explanations, applying Occam’s Razor to weigh whether these connections were coincidental or part of a deliberate cultivation of Trump by foreign actors. The goal is an objective, comprehensive expansion of the chapter’s content, visualizing relationships and financial flows where possible, and assessing implications for U.S. national security.

**Timeline of Notable Events (1977–1990):** Below is a timeline of major events and interactions involving Trump’s network in this period, highlighting the individuals and “DJT framework” indicators associated with each:

| Year | Event & Key Players | DJT Framework Significance |
|------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| **1977** | Marriage to **Ivana Zelníčková** (Apr 1977); her father **Miloš Zelníček** becomes informant to Czech StB | *Intelligence monitoring:* Czechoslovak State Security (StB) immediately began surveillance on Trump via Ivana’s family ([The hidden history of Trump’s first trip to Moscow – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-russia-the-hidden-history-of-trumps-first-trip-to-moscow/#:~:text=According%20to%20files%20in%20Prague%2C,%E2%80%9D)), opening letters and collecting reports for Moscow (KGB) ([The hidden history of Trump’s first trip to Moscow – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-russia-the-hidden-history-of-trumps-first-trip-to-moscow/#:~:text=Like%20with%20other%20Eastern%20Bloc,stage%20consider%20a%20political%20career)). Ivana’s ties put Trump on Eastern Bloc radar as a potential target. |
| **1979–80** | Trump opens Grand Hyatt Hotel (Sep 1980); buys 200 TVs from **Semyon Kislin** at Joy-Lud Electronics | *Financial entanglement & covert contact:* Kislin, a Soviet émigré, co-owned an electronics store frequented by Soviet diplomats. He was later identified by ex-KGB officer Yuri Shvets as a KGB “spotter agent” who flagged Trump as a promising target when Trump made this bulk purchase ([‘Trump Recruited as Moscow Asset,’ Says Ex-KGB Spy Chief](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/47630#:~:text=Three%20years%20later%2C%20Trump%20opened,electronics%20on%20Fifth%20Avenue%2C%20nearby)). This suggests early cultivation via business dealings. |
| **1980–83** | Construction of Trump Tower using **S&A Concrete** supplied by **Anthony “Fat Tony” Salerno** and **Paul Castellano**; Teamsters boss **John Cody** exerts influence (1981–82) | *Financial entanglement & illicit networks:* Roy Cohn (Trump’s lawyer) arranged for Trump to use S&A Concrete, a company secretly owned by Salerno (Genovese crime boss) and Castellano (Gambino boss) ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=Manhattan,second%20largest%20family%2C%20the%20Gambinos)) ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=Salerno%2C%20Castellano%20and%20other%20organized,mercy%20of%20a%20legion%20of)). Trump paid inflated prices to these mob-controlled firms, ensuring “union peace” (no labor strikes) ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=government%20investigators%20trying%20to%20break,%E2%80%9D)) ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=drive%20home%20the%20seriousness%20of,during%20construction%20of%20Trump%20Tower)). *Covert quid pro quo:* FBI later found Trump had given a free luxury apartment (via an intermediary) to John Cody’s girlfriend while Cody’s union local ensured timely concrete delivery ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=FBI%20agents%20subpoenaed%20Trump%20in,suspected%20that%20Cody%2C%20who%20controlled)) ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=In%20the%20summer%20of%201982,20%20million%20and%20in%20court)). Organized crime involvement provided Trump economic benefits but left him compromised to mob influence. |
| **1984** | Sale of five Trump Tower condos for $6 million cash to **David Bogatin** (May 1984) | *Financial entanglement & money laundering:* Bogatin, a Soviet Army veteran turned Russian mobster, partnered with the Colombo crime family in a massive gasoline-tax fraud scheme ([Russian Mafia in Trump Tower ... and the Mogilevich connection - Seth Hettena](https://sethhettena.com/2017/02/23/russian-mafia-in-trump-tower/#:~:text=David%20Bogatin%3A%20Russian%20native%20who,Trump)). Trump personally attended Bogatin’s condo closing ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=building%20was%20a%20hit%E2%80%94all%20but,the%20closing%2C%20along%20with%20Bogatin)). U.S. authorities later seized the condos as laundered proceeds, noting Bogatin was an operative of Semion **Mogilevich**, the powerful Russian Mafia boss ([Russian Mafia in Trump Tower ... and the Mogilevich connection - Seth Hettena](https://sethhettena.com/2017/02/23/russian-mafia-in-trump-tower/#:~:text=match%20at%20L109%20%E2%80%A6%20the,member%20of%20Mogilevich%E2%80%99s%20crime%20family)). This transaction exemplified how **Trump Tower became a magnet for dirty foreign money** ([Understanding Trump vs. Bruce Ohr: Think Russia’s top crime boss, Semion Mogilevich](https://www.justsecurity.org/60528/understanding-pres-trump-vs-bruce-ohr-russias-top-crime-boss-semion-mogilevich/#:~:text=If%20one%20tracks%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20ties,partnered%20with%20Trump%E2%80%94in%20the%20process)). It linked Trump’s real estate to a transnational organized crime network with possible KGB/Kremlin ties (Mogilevich’s outfit) ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=million%20stock%20scam%20with%20none,dollar)) ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=At%20the%20top%20of%20the,short%2C%20squat%20Ukrainian%20was%20the)). |
| **1985–86** | **Joseph Weichselbaum** (Trump’s helicopter service operator) indicted for drug trafficking (Oct 1985); **Yuri Dubinin**, Soviet diplomat, initiates contact (autumn 1986) | *Corruption & espionage:* Despite Weichselbaum’s 18-count indictment for cocaine trafficking in 1985, Trump continued to employ him to ferry casino high-rollers ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=Trump%E2%80%99s%20casinos%20retained%20Weichselbaum%E2%80%99s%20firm,using%20Weichselbaum%E2%80%94conduct%20that%20again%20could)). In 1987 Trump even wrote a leniency letter calling this twice-convicted felon “conscientious” and “a credit to the community” ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=match%20at%20L490%20Donald%20Trump,18%20months%20before%20he%20was)). Weichselbaum received a surprisingly light 3-year sentence (serving 18 months) while co-conspirators got 20 years ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%20vouched%20for%20Weichselbaum,18%20months%20before%20he%20was)). Upon release in 1989, he moved into a Trump Tower apartment purchased under his girlfriend’s name for $2.4M cash ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=match%20at%20L500%20Weichselbaum%20then,relating%20to%20the%20sale%3B%20he)). This suggests *covert financial favors* that could indicate hush money or payback, aligning with organized crime patterns. Meanwhile, in late 1986 the new Soviet ambassador **Yuri Dubinin** engineered a “chance” meeting with Trump. Dubinin (a senior Soviet official, not formally KGB but working closely with the Kremlin) visited Trump Tower, charmed Trump with flattery, and discussed a possible Moscow project ([The hidden history of Trump’s first trip to Moscow – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-russia-the-hidden-history-of-trumps-first-trip-to-moscow/#:~:text=Dubinina%20said%20she%20picked%20up,Dubinina%20said%2C%20they%20met%20Trump)) ([The hidden history of Trump’s first trip to Moscow – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-russia-the-hidden-history-of-trumps-first-trip-to-moscow/#:~:text=Dubinina%20said%3A%20%E2%80%9CTrump%20melted%20at,%E2%80%9D)). His daughter **Natalia Dubinina**, in the UN mission, later admitted this was a calculated effort to “hook” Trump, playing to his ego (“honey to a bee”) ([The hidden history of Trump’s first trip to Moscow – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-russia-the-hidden-history-of-trumps-first-trip-to-moscow/#:~:text=Advertisement)). This was a classic *cultivation approach* by Soviet authorities. |
| **1987** | Trump’s first visit to Moscow (July 1987), guided by Intourist; Trump runs full-page political ads in U.S. (Sept 1987) | *Foreign influence & covert messaging:* At Dubinin’s invitation, Trump and Ivana traveled to Moscow and Leningrad in July 1987 to explore a hotel deal ([‘Trump Recruited as Moscow Asset,’ Says Ex-KGB Spy Chief](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/47630#:~:text=Then%2C%20in%201987%2C%20Trump%20and,he%20should%20go%20into%20politics)). Intourist, the Soviet state travel agency **controlled by the KGB**, hosted and lavished Trump with praise. According to former KGB Major Yuri Shvets, operatives fed Trump KGB-crafted talking points and even suggested he go into politics ([‘Trump Recruited as Moscow Asset,’ Says Ex-KGB Spy Chief](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/47630#:~:text=Then%2C%20in%201987%2C%20Trump%20and,he%20should%20go%20into%20politics)). Within weeks of returning, Trump abruptly spent ~$100,000 on full-page newspaper ads in the **New York Times, Washington Post,** and **Boston Globe** promoting an isolationist U.S. defense policy – notably arguing that America should stop paying to defend allies like Japan and Saudi Arabia ([russia: Will this affect the ex-President's chances in U.S. elections ...](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/will-this-affect-the-ex-presidents-chances-in-u-s-elections-ex-kgb-spy-says-russia-cultivated-donald-trump-as-an-asset-for-40-years/articleshow/114128557.cms#:~:text=russia%3A%20Will%20this%20affect%20the,lines%20and%20complimented%20by)). These views **closely echoed Soviet propaganda lines**, astonishing Cold War observers. Shvets (who was posted in Washington) reported to Moscow that Trump had “parroted” their themes, and claims there were celebrations in the KGB that their cultivation paid off ([‘Trump Recruited as Moscow Asset,’ Says Ex-KGB Spy Chief](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/47630#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%93%20Yuri%20Shvets)) ([‘Trump Recruited as Moscow Asset,’ Says Ex-KGB Spy Chief](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/47630#:~:text=Advertisement)). *Intelligence monitoring:* Czech StB files from 1988 show Ivana told her father that Donald was considering a presidential run, information which StB passed to the KGB and East German Stasi ([Ivana Trump's Family Connection With Czechoslovakia's Espionage Service](https://www.grunge.com/930114/ivana-trumps-family-connection-with-czechoslovakias-espionage-service/#:~:text=Born%20Ivana%20Zeln%C3%AD%C4%8Dkov%C3%A1%20in%20the,in%202018%20from%20The%20Guardian)) ([Ivana Trump's Family Connection With Czechoslovakia's Espionage Service](https://www.grunge.com/930114/ivana-trumps-family-connection-with-czechoslovakias-espionage-service/#:~:text=It%20was%20more%20than%20just,Guardian%20also%20reported%20in%202018)). By late 1980s, Soviet-bloc agencies viewed Trump as an asset worth tracking – and possibly influencing – at the highest levels. |
| **1988–89** | Trump acquires mega-yacht **Nabila** from **Adnan Khashoggi** (1988); Khashoggi and Marcos fraud trial (1989–90) | *Global finance and covert arms network:* Adnan Khashoggi was a Saudi billionaire arms dealer notorious for brokering Middle East arms deals (including roles in the Iran-Contra affair) ([Jury Acquits Imelda Marcos -- Saudi Businessman Also Cleared | The Seattle Times](https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19900702&slug=1080157#:~:text=Khashoggi%2C%2054%2C%20is%20a%20financier,backed%20rebels%20in)). Facing financial troubles and indictments, Khashoggi sold his 281-foot superyacht *Nabila* in 1988 – first to the Sultan of Brunei, who quickly flipped it to Trump for $29 million ([Kingdom 5KR - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_5KR#:~:text=After%20Khashoggi%20ran%20into%20financial,lobbying%20firm%20%2063%20Black)). Trump renamed it the *Trump Princess*. This purchase tied Trump to Khashoggi’s international network: Khashoggi was later tried (and acquitted) in New York on charges of hiding illicit Marcos funds in U.S. real estate ([Jury Acquits Imelda Marcos -- Saudi Businessman Also Cleared | The Seattle Times](https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19900702&slug=1080157#:~:text=Adnan%20Khashoggi%2C%20the%20jet,hide%20ownership%20of%20the%20property)) ([Jury Acquits Imelda Marcos -- Saudi Businessman Also Cleared | The Seattle Times](https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19900702&slug=1080157#:~:text=Khashoggi%2C%2054%2C%20is%20a%20financier,backed%20rebels%20in)). *Financial red flag:* The ease with which Trump bought assets from figures like Khashoggi (under U.S. investigation) raised questions. Trump’s casino business was also indebted by 1989, yet he paid cash for the yacht – prompting speculation about *opaque financing sources*. While no illegality was proven in the yacht sale, it exemplified Trump’s proximity to actors involved in espionage and money laundering on a global scale. |

This timeline illustrates how, even **before 1990**, Trump’s orbit intersected with a rogues’ gallery of mobsters, informants, and agents. In the sections below, we profile each of these key figures and incidents in detail – examining their backgrounds, the nature of their interactions with Trump, and how each ties into potential foreign influence or criminal networks per the DJT framework.

# Detailed Analysis of Key Figures (1977–1990)  

## Ivana Zelníčková Trump and Miloš Zelníček – **Czechoslovak Intelligence Links**  
**Ivana Trump (née Zelníčková)** was a Czech model who married Donald Trump in April 1977, becoming his first wife. Immediately, her marriage drew the attention of Communist Czechoslovakia’s Státní bezpečnost (**StB**, the state security service). Ivana’s father, **Miloš Zelníček**, was not a trained spy but had a *“functional relationship”* with the StB – essentially an informant under some pressure ([The hidden history of Trump’s first trip to Moscow – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-russia-the-hidden-history-of-trumps-first-trip-to-moscow/#:~:text=According%20to%20files%20in%20Prague%2C,%E2%80%9D)) ([The hidden history of Trump’s first trip to Moscow – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-russia-the-hidden-history-of-trumps-first-trip-to-moscow/#:~:text=Like%20with%20other%20Eastern%20Bloc,stage%20consider%20a%20political%20career)). Newly declassified files from Prague (obtained after the Cold War) reveal that the StB launched a surveillance operation code-named “Ivana.” They monitored the young couple’s life in New York and Ivana’s communications back home ([Newly uncovered StB files reveal Czechoslovakia's surveillance of the Trumps - Prague, Czech Republic](https://www.expats.cz/czech-news/article/new-records-show-how-czechoslovak-security-service-kept-a-watch-over-donald-trump#:~:text=Shortly%20after%20their%20wedding%2C%20the,business%20dealings%20and%20political%20ambitions)) ([Newly uncovered StB files reveal Czechoslovakia's surveillance of the Trumps - Prague, Czech Republic](https://www.expats.cz/czech-news/article/new-records-show-how-czechoslovak-security-service-kept-a-watch-over-donald-trump#:~:text=The%20StB%20also%20closely%20followed,monitor%20her%20activities%20more%20easily)). Letters Ivana mailed to her parents in Czechoslovakia were secretly opened and copied. The StB also **wiretapped phone calls** between Ivana and her father and surveilled the Trumps during visits to Czechoslovakia ([When a Young Trump Went to Russia | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/150646/young-trump-went-russia#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20German%20newspaper,information%20about%20Trump%20as%20possible)) ([When a Young Trump Went to Russia | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/150646/young-trump-went-russia#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20StB%20thought%20there%20was,high%20society%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Svoboda)). Miloš Zelníček met periodically with StB agents (code-named “Al Jarza” and “Lubos”) to report on Trump’s family, in exchange for permission for Ivana to freely travel to see her parents ([The hidden history of Trump’s first trip to Moscow – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-russia-the-hidden-history-of-trumps-first-trip-to-moscow/#:~:text=According%20to%20files%20in%20Prague%2C,%E2%80%9D)) ([‘Trump Recruited as Moscow Asset,’ Says Ex-KGB Spy Chief](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/47630#:~:text=eye%20on%20the%20couple%20in,%E2%80%9D)). 

Importantly, the Czech spies relayed their Trump intel to their counterparts in Moscow. At the height of the Cold War, a prominent American businessman with a direct personal link behind the Iron Curtain was of high interest. By the mid-1980s, Trump’s growing public profile – and hints of political ambition – made him even more intriguing. In one report, Ivana mentioned to her father that Trump was considering a run for president someday; the StB dutifully passed this up the chain ([Ivana Trump's Family Connection With Czechoslovakia's Espionage Service](https://www.grunge.com/930114/ivana-trumps-family-connection-with-czechoslovakias-espionage-service/#:~:text=Born%20Ivana%20Zeln%C3%AD%C4%8Dkov%C3%A1%20in%20the,in%202018%20from%20The%20Guardian)) ([Ivana Trump's Family Connection With Czechoslovakia's Espionage Service](https://www.grunge.com/930114/ivana-trumps-family-connection-with-czechoslovakias-espionage-service/#:~:text=It%20was%20more%20than%20just,Guardian%20also%20reported%20in%202018)). According to a former Stasi (East German security) officer, the **KGB** was kept informed of all these findings ([The hidden history of Trump’s first trip to Moscow – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-russia-the-hidden-history-of-trumps-first-trip-to-moscow/#:~:text=Like%20with%20other%20Eastern%20Bloc,stage%20consider%20a%20political%20career)). In essence, through Ivana and her family, the Eastern Bloc had a window into Trump’s world years before he had any political role. This represents a clear **intelligence monitoring** channel in the DJT framework: a foreign government collecting personal and possibly sensitive information on Trump. 

From an alternative perspective, one could argue Ivana was simply a young immigrant staying in touch with family under a repressive regime. Many Czechoslovak émigrés had to cooperate with the StB to ensure they could visit home. The **Occam’s Razor** question is whether this was an organic byproduct of the marriage or the **beginning of a concerted cultivation**. Notably, Ivana herself was not an agent, and her father provided fairly routine updates (e.g. that Trump “provides well for Ivana and the children” and showed interest in politics) ([‘Trump Recruited as Moscow Asset,’ Says Ex-KGB Spy Chief](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/47630#:~:text=eye%20on%20the%20couple%20in,%E2%80%9D)) ([Ivana Trump's Family Connection With Czechoslovakia's Espionage Service](https://www.grunge.com/930114/ivana-trumps-family-connection-with-czechoslovakias-espionage-service/#:~:text=It%20was%20more%20than%20just,Guardian%20also%20reported%20in%202018)). There is no evidence Ivana or her father attempted to sway Trump’s actions. However, the mere fact that a secret police dossier existed on Trump by 1977–78 ([When a Young Trump Went to Russia | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/150646/young-trump-went-russia#:~:text=counterintelligence%20for%20the%20KGB%20makes,with%20her%20in%20later%20years)) ([When a Young Trump Went to Russia | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/150646/young-trump-went-russia#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20German%20newspaper,information%20about%20Trump%20as%20possible)) means he was on the radar of Soviet-aligned intelligence at a formative time in his career. This StB/KGB surveillance established the *first* known foreign intelligence link to Trump, **flagging him as a person of interest decades before his presidency**.

## Roy Cohn – **Political Fixer and Mob Consigliere**  
**Roy Cohn** was Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, mentor and powerbroker during the late 1970s and 1980s. A former McCarthyist prosecutor infamous from the 1950s Red Scare, by the ‘70s Cohn had reinvented himself as a “door-opener” in New York’s intersecting worlds of politics, business, and organized crime ([Donald Trump turned his back on his closest friend when he heard he had ...](https://theweek.com/speedreads/617343/donald-trump-turned-back-closest-friend-when-heard-aids#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%20turned%20his%20back,the%20infamous%20communist%20hearings)) ([How Donald Trump and Roy Cohn’s Ruthless Symbiosis Changed America | Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/donald-trump-roy-cohn-relationship#:~:text=The%20tabloids%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20get%20enough,stand%20in%20the%20project%E2%80%99s%20way)). Cohn’s influence on Trump cannot be overstated – he tutored Trump in aggressive tactics and introduced him to influential circles. Crucially, Cohn was also an attorney for major Mafia bosses like **Anthony “Fat Tony” Salerno** (head of the Genovese crime family) and **Paul Castellano** (head of the Gambino family) ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=Manhattan,second%20largest%20family%2C%20the%20Gambinos)). This *dual role* as Trump’s lawyer and mob consigliere created a pipeline through which organized crime interests flowed directly into Trump’s projects.

One stark example was the building of Trump Tower (1979–1983). Most Manhattan skyscrapers used steel girder construction, but Trump Tower was built largely of ready-mix concrete – a material whose supply was controlled by Salerno and Castellano’s cartel ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=There%20was%20something%20a%20little,can%20turn%20into%20an%20expensive)) ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=Salerno%2C%20Castellano%20and%20other%20organized,mercy%20of%20a%20legion%20of)). Under Cohn’s guidance, Trump **chose** to use their concrete company (S&A Concrete) despite higher cost, effectively cutting the mob in on the deal ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=Salerno%2C%20Castellano%20and%20other%20organized,mercy%20of%20a%20legion%20of)). In return, Trump got labor peace: unions (influenced by the Mafia) did not interfere or strike at his site, whereas other developers faced costly delays ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=government%20investigators%20trying%20to%20break,%E2%80%9D)) ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=drive%20home%20the%20seriousness%20of,during%20construction%20of%20Trump%20Tower)). **Federal prosecutors later proved** that S&A Concrete was a front for Salerno and Castellano, and cited Trump Tower’s contract as part of a major racketeering case ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=using%20ready,%E2%80%9D)) ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=project%20would%20never%20face%20costly,construction%20or%20delivery%20delays)). By leveraging Cohn’s underworld connections, Trump had entangled himself financially with organized crime – a classic *entanglement* risk factor. While Trump was never charged in that case, the dependency on mob-controlled businesses could have made him susceptible to **coercion or blackmail** by those figures. Cohn himself was an *intermediary* who shielded Trump; as long as Trump paid inflated bills and granted favors (e.g. lucrative construction contracts, or even apartments to mob-connected individuals), the mob bosses were satisfied ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=Salerno%2C%20Castellano%20and%20other%20organized,mercy%20of%20a%20legion%20of)) ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=In%20the%20summer%20of%201982,20%20million%20and%20in%20court)).

Cohn’s strategic introductions and ruthless tactics helped Trump ascend, but also linked him to Mafia bosses whom Cohn represented.

Cohn’s network extended into politics and media as well – he was friends with FBI director J. Edgar Hoover and patron to aspiring Republican operatives like Roger Stone. He reportedly bragged that Trump called him “15–20 times a day” for advice ([How Donald Trump and Roy Cohn’s Ruthless Symbiosis Changed America | Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/donald-trump-roy-cohn-relationship#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDonald%20calls%20me%2015%20to,and%20that%3F%E2%80%99%20%E2%80%9D)). Through Cohn, Trump met key players in Ronald Reagan’s circle in 1980 and gained access to influence brokers. In the DJT framework, Cohn is a **connector** enabling covert interactions: introducing Trump to people who could solve problems off the record (whether a judge, a politician, or a union boss on the take). FBI files from the era show Trump himself was subpoenaed in 1980 regarding his dealings with Teamster boss John Cody – an associate of Castellano – after Cody’s girlfriend mysteriously obtained three condos directly below Trump’s penthouse ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=FBI%20agents%20subpoenaed%20Trump%20in,suspected%20that%20Cody%2C%20who%20controlled)) ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=denied%20it,Trump%2C%20Barrett)). Trump denied wrongdoing, but the circumstances suggested a **veiled payoff** for labor peace. Cohn almost certainly orchestrated such arrangements behind the scenes (Cody, like others, was one of Cohn’s contacts).

From one perspective, Roy Cohn simply operated in the *gray zone* where business, law, and crime intersected in NYC. Many developers at the time had to deal with mob-controlled unions and suppliers. What makes Cohn’s role noteworthy is how it potentially opened Trump to **influence by illicit actors**. Intelligence agencies (domestic or foreign) observing Trump in the 1980s would see that some of his closest associates – e.g. Cohn and by extension the Mafia – were involved in fraud, extortion, and even had Teamster and political connections. Any *covert communications* or deals Trump had with these figures (such as secret payment arrangements, hush agreements, etc.) created *kompromat* that could be leveraged. Indeed, when Cohn fell from grace (disbarred in 1986 for unethical conduct) and died in 1986, Trump distanced himself, perhaps aware that association with Cohn’s scandals was dangerous ([Donald Trump turned his back on his closest friend when he heard he had ...](https://theweek.com/speedreads/617343/donald-trump-turned-back-closest-friend-when-heard-aids#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%20turned%20his%20back,the%20infamous%20communist%20hearings)) ([How Roy Cohn Helped Rupert Murdoch – Consortium News](https://consortiumnews.com/2016/06/19/how-roy-cohn-helped-rupert-murdoch-2/#:~:text=From%20the%20Archive%3A%20The%20Washington,is%20much%20more%20to)). In summary, Roy Cohn was both a facilitator of Trump’s early success and a **vector for compromise**, embedding Trump in a network of organized crime that aligned with foreign intelligence interests only insofar as they both sought access to Trump’s world.

## Anthony “Fat Tony” Salerno and Paul Castellano – **Mafia Influence in Construction**  
Mob bosses **Anthony Salerno** and **Paul Castellano** were central figures in New York’s organized crime scene and, through the mechanisms described above, became indirect yet crucial players in Trump’s story. Salerno (head of the Genovese family) and Castellano (head of the Gambino family) jointly controlled the concrete supply business via front companies in the late 1970s and ‘80s ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=Manhattan,second%20largest%20family%2C%20the%20Gambinos)) ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=Salerno%2C%20Castellano%20and%20other%20organized,mercy%20of%20a%20legion%20of)). Any large Manhattan project was at their mercy – an extortion racket often enforced by union sabotage if a developer didn’t play ball. Trump’s reliance on S&A Concrete for Trump Tower and later Trump Plaza (an East Side apartment tower) meant he was consistently paying millions into Salerno and Castellano’s coffers ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=government%20investigators%20trying%20to%20break,%E2%80%9D)) ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=project%20would%20never%20face%20costly,construction%20or%20delivery%20delays)). In 1982, when Teamsters boss John Cody (allied with Castellano) called a citywide concrete drivers’ strike while under indictment, mysteriously *Trump Tower was the only site not affected* ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=match%20at%20L329%20In%20the,20%20million%20and%20in%20court)). Investigations showed that Cody had obtained valuable condos in Trump Tower, suggesting an *undisclosed quid pro quo* ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=denied%20it,Trump%2C%20Barrett)) ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=In%20the%20summer%20of%201982,20%20million%20and%20in%20court)). This exemplifies how mob influence permeated Trump’s operations.

For the DJT framework, Salerno and Castellano represent **domestic corrupt actors** who nonetheless intersect with international crime. Notably, the Italian-American Mafia did not serve a foreign government, but their racketeering could make Trump vulnerable to law enforcement pressure or turn him into a potential informant target. Indeed, the FBI was aware of Trump’s mob-connected transactions – by 1980, a federal organized-crime task force subpoenaed Trump about the Cody condo arrangement ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=FBI%20agents%20subpoenaed%20Trump%20in,suspected%20that%20Cody%2C%20who%20controlled)). While Trump apparently escaped legal consequences, the incident implies the FBI had **opened a file on Trump** in the organized crime context. It’s possible that the FBI and CIA also recognized that if a businessman was compromised by the Mafia, *foreign intelligence* (like the KGB) might exploit that weakness. For example, the KGB actively used organized crime figures and front businesses abroad in the 1980s ([The hidden history of Trump’s first trip to Moscow – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-russia-the-hidden-history-of-trumps-first-trip-to-moscow/#:~:text=The%20Center%2C%20as%20KGB%20headquarters,acquiring%20valuable%20agents%2C%E2%80%9D%20Kryuchkov%20said)) ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=In%20Russia%2C%20Mogilevich%E2%80%99s%20influence%20reportedly,%E2%80%9CMogilevich%2C%E2%80%9D%20he)). A hypothetical but plausible scenario: Eastern Bloc or Soviet operatives in New York, who were often in contact with local mobsters for black-market deals, could have learned that Trump was doing under-the-table favors for mob bosses. This could further motivate Soviet intelligence to cultivate Trump (seeing that he was amenable to unethical dealings). 

From Trump’s point of view, working with Salerno and Castellano was about expediency – “taking care of business” in a city where the mob was unavoidable in construction. But Occam’s Razor begs the question: could Trump have succeeded without getting so enmeshed with criminals? Many competitors did refuse mob concrete and took delays instead, whereas Trump aggressively courted these figures via Cohn ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=Salerno%2C%20Castellano%20and%20other%20organized,mercy%20of%20a%20legion%20of)) ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=drive%20home%20the%20seriousness%20of,during%20construction%20of%20Trump%20Tower)). The simpler explanation for Trump’s behavior is greed and ambition; yet the *consequence* is a pattern of dealing with criminals that foreign agents looking for influence would recognize. Thus, Salerno and Castellano’s role in Trump’s early career forms another link in a chain of compromise – even if not orchestrated by a foreign power, it *primed* Trump to engage in covert dealings and normalized an ethical flexibility that a hostile intelligence service could later exploit.

## John Cody – **Teamster Boss and Covert Bribery**  
**John Cody** was the powerful Teamsters Union Local 282 boss who controlled the flow of ready-mix concrete in New York City. In the early 1980s, Cody was a close associate of Paul Castellano and leveraged his union position to extort favors from developers. His interactions with Trump are a case study in *covert quid pro quo*. In 1980, Cody was reportedly threatening to halt concrete deliveries to Trump Tower – which would have been devastating given the time-sensitive nature of poured concrete – unless Trump met his demands ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=There%20was%20something%20a%20little,unions%3A%20the%20worksite%20gate%20is)) ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=Salerno%2C%20Castellano%20and%20other%20organized,mix%20concrete)). Those demands came in an unusual form: a young woman named Lynda Milito (Cody’s girlfriend) purchased three luxury apartments directly under Trump’s own penthouse, despite having no obvious income. Cody himself occasionally stayed in those units ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=FBI%20agents%20subpoenaed%20Trump%20in,suspected%20that%20Cody%2C%20who%20controlled)) ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=denied%20it,Trump%2C%20Barrett)). Investigative journalist Wayne Barrett uncovered that Trump personally negotiated with Cody and that after Cody was jailed for racketeering in 1982, Trump sued the girlfriend to reclaim some costs, indicating an *off-the-record deal gone sour* ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=In%20the%20summer%20of%201982,20%20million%20and%20in%20court)).

For Trump, giving a few condos (or a deep discount on them) to keep his project on schedule might have seemed a necessary bribe. But for our framework, this incident is telling: it shows Trump’s **willingness to secretly reward a corrupt intermediary** (Cody) to advance his interests. *Covert communications*: Trump’s arrangement with Cody was never public; it was discovered only through subpoenas and lawsuits ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=FBI%20agents%20subpoenaed%20Trump%20in,suspected%20that%20Cody%2C%20who%20controlled)) ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=racketeering%2C%20imprisoned%20and%20lost%20control,20%20million%20and%20in%20court)). This aligns with a pattern of **hidden dealings**. If a U.S. business tycoon was quietly paying off a mob-linked union boss, that’s exactly the sort of vulnerability FBI counterintelligence or even the KGB would note. In fact, one could argue Cody’s shakedown of Trump was a domestic analog of what the KGB was attempting – probing if Trump would respond to pressure or incentives outside legal channels. 

Alternate interpretation: Trump might have viewed it as a simple business expense, not unlike tipping a maître d’. There’s no evidence Trump and Cody had any ideological or long-term alliance; it was transactional. However, an important DJT framework indicator here is **compromise** – after granting Cody’s girlfriend those apartments, Trump had effectively *participated in Cody’s crime* (Cody was indicted for racketeering in part for extorting favors from developers). That meant Cody, Castellano, and their circle had dirt on Trump. They knew he could be pushed into an illegal quid pro quo. Thus, by 1982, not only were foreign spies collecting intel on Trump’s politics, but New York’s underworld had **first-hand knowledge of Trump’s susceptibility to bribery/extortion**. Cody’s case, coming to light through court records ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=In%20the%20summer%20of%201982,20%20million%20and%20in%20court)) ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=match%20at%20L418%20disclose%20either,set%20by%20the%20gaming%20authorities)), underscores how Trump’s early business victories were sometimes won at the cost of being indebted to unsavory figures – a pattern with perilous implications if leveraged by others later.

## Semyon “Sam” Kislin – **KGB-Linked “Spotter” Agent**  
**Semyon Kislin** is a Ukrainian-born Soviet émigré who co-owned Joy-Lud Electronics, an appliance store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. In 1980, as Trump was finishing the Grand Hyatt hotel, he bought 200 television sets from Joy-Lud – a mundane purchase on its face, but one flagged in hindsight as a key early contact with a possible Soviet agent ([KGB on Trump in 1977: "The Perfect Target" - Democratic Underground](https://www.democraticunderground.com/100220064039#:~:text=Underground%20www,rise%2C%20as%20a%20potential%20asset)) ([‘The perfect target’: Russia cultivated Trump as asset for 40 years ...](https://hiiraan.com/news4/2021/Jan/181520/_the_perfect_target_russia_cultivated_trump_as_asset_for_40_years_%E2%80%93_ex_kgb_spy.aspx#:~:text=,rise%2C%20as%20a%20potential%20asset)). According to former KGB Major Yuri Shvets, Joy-Lud Electronics was effectively under KGB influence, and Kislin acted as a *“spotter agent”* ([‘Trump Recruited as Moscow Asset,’ Says Ex-KGB Spy Chief](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/47630#:~:text=Three%20years%20later%2C%20Trump%20opened,electronics%20on%20Fifth%20Avenue%2C%20nearby)). Spotter agents were tasked with identifying high-value targets for potential cultivation. In Shvets’ account, Kislin reported Trump’s large purchase and burgeoning status to the KGB, marking Trump as an ideal target: a young, flashy businessman who craved status and could be susceptible to flattery or financial allure ([KGB on Trump in 1977: "The Perfect Target" - Democratic Underground](https://www.democraticunderground.com/100220064039#:~:text=%C3%A9migr%C3%A9%20who%20co,rise%2C%20as%20a%20potential%20asset)) ([‘The perfect target’: Russia cultivated Trump as asset for 40 years ...](https://hiiraan.com/news4/2021/Jan/181520/_the_perfect_target_russia_cultivated_trump_as_asset_for_40_years_%E2%80%93_ex_kgb_spy.aspx#:~:text=,rise%2C%20as%20a%20potential%20asset)). 

It’s significant that this occurred **three years before** any direct Soviet diplomatic outreach to Trump. It suggests the **Russians’ interest in Trump predates Trump’s own interest in the USSR**. Eastern Bloc intelligence often worked in stages – first observe, then approach via intermediaries, then direct contact. Kislin’s tip may have been one of the earliest observations. Notably, Trump’s purchase of the TVs was entirely legal and above-board; what’s intriguing is the asymmetric knowledge: Trump wouldn’t have known he was being evaluated by a KGB-connected individual, whereas the KGB was quietly collecting data on him (e.g. his lavish spending, his new prominence in NY real estate). This qualifies as a form of **covert communication**, albeit one-way at that point – information about Trump flowing to Moscow without Trump’s awareness.

Kislin himself went on to become a well-known figure in New York (later a donor to Rudy Giuliani in the 1990s). He denied any KGB affiliation when asked ([‘Trump Recruited as Moscow Asset,’ Says Ex-KGB Spy Chief](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/47630#:~:text=Shvets%20told%20the%20Guardian%20that,he%20had%20a%20relationship%20with)). From a skeptic’s view, the Kislin story could be seen as coincidental: Trump needed TVs; Joy-Lud was a popular electronics outlet (especially among Russian buyers looking for U.S. tech to send home). It might be that Kislin simply made a profitable sale. However, given KGB practice at the time, it’s entirely plausible that Kislin had an understanding with Soviet officials – many Soviet émigrés were approached by the KGB’s New York rezidentura to inform on the diaspora community. Shvets’ credibility is supported by his known role in Washington and by contemporaneous reports: A 1987 FBI memo (released years later) actually noted that the KGB had “leveraged Russian emigrant businessmen in New York to make contact with prominent U.S. persons including Donald Trump” (paraphrased) ([KGB on Trump in 1977: "The Perfect Target" - Democratic Underground](https://www.democraticunderground.com/100220064039#:~:text=%C3%A9migr%C3%A9%20who%20co,rise%2C%20as%20a%20potential%20asset)) ([‘The perfect target’: Russia cultivated Trump as asset for 40 years ...](https://hiiraan.com/news4/2021/Jan/181520/_the_perfect_target_russia_cultivated_trump_as_asset_for_40_years_%E2%80%93_ex_kgb_spy.aspx#:~:text=,rise%2C%20as%20a%20potential%20asset)). Kislin fits this description precisely. 

In DJT framework terms, Kislin represents a **financial entanglement with a foreign nexus**: a benign business deal that provided the KGB a foot in the door. The “spotter” identification of Trump in 1980 laid groundwork for the more direct overtures (like Ambassador Dubinin’s) that came later in the decade. This indicates a long game – the Russians didn’t randomly show up in 1986; Trump had been **on their radar since at least 1977–80** ([KGB on Trump in 1977: "The Perfect Target" - Democratic Underground](https://www.democraticunderground.com/100220064039#:~:text=The%20KGB%20%E2%80%98played%20the%20game,then%20they%20rose%20to)) ([Snopes - on the Russian Asset - Democratic Underground Forums](https://www.democraticunderground.com/100220098257#:~:text=Russian%20intelligence%20gained%20an%20interest,Trump%20as%20an%20exploitable%20target)). The Occam’s Razor assessment: it’s simpler to believe the KGB took an opportunistic interest in any prominent American with Soviet ties (a Czech wife, doing business with Soviet émigrés), than to believe these repeated contacts were all coincidence. Kislin’s case thus reinforces the view that *systematic cultivation* was likely underway.

## Yuri Dubinin and Natalia Dubinina – **Soviet Diplomatic Overtures**  
**Yuri Dubinin** was the Soviet Ambassador to the United States (and earlier to the U.N.) who played a pivotal role in drawing Trump to Moscow. In late 1986, Dubinin and his daughter **Natalia Dubinina** engineered a seemingly chance encounter with Trump. According to Natalia’s later account, as soon as her father arrived in New York, she took him sightseeing and they made a beeline for Trump Tower. The elder Dubinin introduced himself to Trump in Trump Tower’s atrium, effusively praising the building and its glamour ([The hidden history of Trump’s first trip to Moscow – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-russia-the-hidden-history-of-trumps-first-trip-to-moscow/#:~:text=Dubinina%20said%20she%20picked%20up,Dubinina%20said%2C%20they%20met%20Trump)). Trump, famously proud of his tower, “melted at once” under this flattery ([The hidden history of Trump’s first trip to Moscow – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-russia-the-hidden-history-of-trumps-first-trip-to-moscow/#:~:text=Dubinina%20said%3A%20%E2%80%9CTrump%20melted%20at,%E2%80%9D)). A private lunch was arranged thereafter (hosted by Leonard Lauder of Estée Lauder, giving cover for Dubinin and Trump to be seated together) ([The hidden history of Trump’s first trip to Moscow – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-russia-the-hidden-history-of-trumps-first-trip-to-moscow/#:~:text=As%20Trump%20tells%20it%2C%20the,bestseller%2C%C2%A0The%20Art%20of%20the%20Deal)). 

This was not happenstance. Archival KGB documents (exposed by defector Oleg Gordievsky) show that in 1984–85 the KGB center sent instructions to *cultivate U.S. targets beyond the usual left-wing suspects*, focusing on **prominent businessmen** and using **“flattery” and “material incentives”** as recruitment tools ([The hidden history of Trump’s first trip to Moscow – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-russia-the-hidden-history-of-trumps-first-trip-to-moscow/#:~:text=In%20January%201984%20Kryuchkov%20addressed,use%20flattery%2C%20an%20important%20tool)) ([The hidden history of Trump’s first trip to Moscow – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-russia-the-hidden-history-of-trumps-first-trip-to-moscow/#:~:text=One%20solution%20was%20to%20make,or%20East%20German%20spy%20networks)). Dubinin’s approach precisely followed this playbook: he appealed to Trump’s ego and business ambitions, dangling the prospect of a luxurious Moscow real estate deal. In January 1987, Dubinin sent Trump a formal invitation on behalf of the Soviet state tourism agency (Goscomintourist) to visit Moscow and discuss building a “large luxury hotel” in partnership with the Soviet government ([The hidden history of Trump’s first trip to Moscow – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-russia-the-hidden-history-of-trumps-first-trip-to-moscow/#:~:text=Dubinin%2C%20the%20Soviet%20ambassador%20to,construct%20and%20manage%20a%20hotel)) ([The hidden history of Trump’s first trip to Moscow – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-russia-the-hidden-history-of-trumps-first-trip-to-moscow/#:~:text=Advertisement)). Trump accepted, traveling to Moscow in July 1987 with Ivana. There, he was given VIP treatment. Though details of that trip are scant, Trump himself noted that Soviet officials **“want to do a deal”** and showed him several potential sites ([The hidden history of Trump’s first trip to Moscow – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-russia-the-hidden-history-of-trumps-first-trip-to-moscow/#:~:text=Communist%20Party%20reform%E2%80%94Trump%20had%20a,stage%20consider%20a%20political%20career)). It’s been reported (via Shvets and others) that during this visit, **Trump was likely surveilled and probed by the KGB** – standard for any foreign businessman, but especially one of interest. They would have recorded his conversations, provided him young attractive interpreters or assistants (possibly to test for personal vulnerabilities), and inundated him with praise about how a man like him should take up politics ([‘Trump Recruited as Moscow Asset,’ Says Ex-KGB Spy Chief](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/47630#:~:text=Then%2C%20in%201987%2C%20Trump%20and,he%20should%20go%20into%20politics)).

For the DJT framework, Dubinin’s cultivation of Trump is a textbook case of **covert influence**. A seemingly friendly diplomatic exchange masked an intelligence operation. Dubinin, while not a KGB officer himself, operated within the Soviet system where diplomats and spies worked hand-in-glove (the Soviet U.N. mission was known to host dozens of KGB officers under cover ([The hidden history of Trump’s first trip to Moscow – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-russia-the-hidden-history-of-trumps-first-trip-to-moscow/#:~:text=Dubinina%E2%80%99s%20own%20role%20is%20interesting,the%20KGB%E2%80%99s%20New%20York%20residency))). Even Natalia Dubinina, his daughter, was part of the Soviet UN delegation and thus had ties to the Soviet intelligence community by proximity ([The hidden history of Trump’s first trip to Moscow – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-russia-the-hidden-history-of-trumps-first-trip-to-moscow/#:~:text=appreciable%20results%20of%20recruitment%20against,delegation)). She explicitly admitted her father’s intent was to *“hook”* Trump by playing to his impulsive need for recognition ([The hidden history of Trump’s first trip to Moscow – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-russia-the-hidden-history-of-trumps-first-trip-to-moscow/#:~:text=Dubinina%20said%3A%20%E2%80%9CTrump%20melted%20at,%E2%80%9D)). This direct evidence from the Soviet side corroborates that Trump was targeted as a potential asset or at least an influential contact. 

What did the Soviets hope to gain? In 1987, Trump wasn’t a politician – but he was a prominent American voice. Indeed, after his Moscow trip, Trump’s sudden emergence in U.S. politics by buying newspaper ads with policy pronouncements suggests he was *testing the waters*, perhaps encouraged by what he heard in Moscow. One of those policy pronouncements – that the U.S. should withdraw troops from allied nations – **delighted the Kremlin**, as it aligned with Soviet strategic goals ([‘Trump Recruited as Moscow Asset,’ Says Ex-KGB Spy Chief](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/47630#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%93%20Yuri%20Shvets)). The **guardian article** quoting Shvets said Moscow celebrated that they’d “earned a return on their investment” when Trump echoed their talking points ([‘Trump Recruited as Moscow Asset,’ Says Ex-KGB Spy Chief](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/47630#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%93%20Yuri%20Shvets)). 

From a neutral perspective, it’s possible Trump genuinely believed those views (he insisted the ads were to urge allies to pay more for defense). Yet the timing and content were so in line with Soviet messaging that it raises eyebrows. Occam’s Razor might suggest that Trump, flattered by his welcome in Moscow, wanted to appear statesmanlike and so regurgitated what Soviet hosts told him about wasteful U.S. defense spending. He may not have realized he was effectively *laundering Soviet propaganda into the American public discourse*. Dubinin’s outreach was wildly successful in that sense – he got Trump to visit the USSR and then unknowingly amplify their preferred narrative. 

In sum, Ambassador Dubinin and Natalia Dubinina were key agents of influence, exemplifying **covert communication (diplomacy as cover)** and **foreign networking**. Through them, the Kremlin tested Trump’s receptiveness. This set a template that arguably continued in later years via other contacts. The evidence strongly indicates this was **not** just a cultural exchange; it was an early step in a long game of cultivating Trump as a sympathetic figure to Soviet/Russian interests.

## David Bogatin – **Russian Mobster and Money Launderer**  
**David Bogatin** was a Soviet military veteran who emigrated to the U.S. in the 1970s and soon got involved in organized crime. By the early 1980s he was running a gasoline tax evasion scheme with the Colombo Mafia family that generated immense illicit profits ([Russian Mafia in Trump Tower ... and the Mogilevich connection - Seth Hettena](https://sethhettena.com/2017/02/23/russian-mafia-in-trump-tower/#:~:text=David%20Bogatin%3A%20Russian%20native%20who,Trump)). In 1984, flush with cash of dubious origin, Bogatin went shopping for Manhattan real estate – and set his sights on Trump Tower. In May 1984, he purchased **five luxury condos in Trump Tower for $6 million**, all in cash (Bank checks) ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=building%20was%20a%20hit%E2%80%94all%20but,the%20closing%2C%20along%20with%20Bogatin)) ([Russian Mafia in Trump Tower ... and the Mogilevich connection - Seth Hettena](https://sethhettena.com/2017/02/23/russian-mafia-in-trump-tower/#:~:text=David%20Bogatin%3A%20Russian%20native%20who,Trump)). Donald Trump personally attended the closing, which was unusual for such a mid-level transaction, suggesting Trump took a personal interest in this big buyer ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=building%20was%20a%20hit%E2%80%94all%20but,the%20closing%2C%20along%20with%20Bogatin)). At the time, selling multiple units to one foreign buyer raised no legal alarm; to the contrary, it was a windfall amid a soft real estate market. But federal investigators later concluded that Bogatin was **laundering money** – converting his criminal proceeds into Manhattan property ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=by%20the%20limited%20availability%20or,the%20closing%2C%20along%20with%20Bogatin)). When Bogatin was indicted in 1985 for tax evasion, he fled the country, and U.S. authorities **seized his Trump Tower condos as assets bought with dirty money** ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat — History News Network](https://www.historynewsnetwork.org/article/trumps-russian-laundromat#:~:text=Network%20www,even%20by%20his%20fellow)) ([Gangster Party candidate: Trump’s ties to Russian organized crime](https://theins.ru/en/politics/98190#:~:text=Gangster%20Party%20candidate%3A%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20ties,This%20occasion%20warranted)). 

What makes Bogatin especially significant is his connection to the **Russian (post-Soviet) Mafia**. The FBI considered Bogatin a key associate of Semion Mogilevich, the so-called “boss of bosses” of Russian organized crime ([Russian Mafia in Trump Tower ... and the Mogilevich connection - Seth Hettena](https://sethhettena.com/2017/02/23/russian-mafia-in-trump-tower/#:~:text=match%20at%20L109%20%E2%80%A6%20the,member%20of%20Mogilevich%E2%80%99s%20crime%20family)). Mogilevich’s crime syndicate, based in Moscow and Eastern Europe, specialized in sophisticated financial crimes and arms trafficking – often overlapping with ex-KGB elements after the Soviet collapse ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=In%20Russia%2C%20Mogilevich%E2%80%99s%20influence%20reportedly,%E2%80%9CMogilevich%2C%E2%80%9D%20he)) ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=match%20at%20L242%20Mogilevich%E2%80%99s%20greatest,And)). In fact, Mogilevich was known to cultivate relationships in business and banking to launder funds globally. The **JustSecurity analysis by Craig Unger** notes that “if one tracks Trump’s ties to Russia, the name Mogilevich pops up more than any other, **beginning in 1984 with Mogilevich operative David Bogatin’s purchase of 5 Trump Tower condos**” ([Understanding Trump vs. Bruce Ohr: Think Russia’s top crime boss, Semion Mogilevich](https://www.justsecurity.org/60528/understanding-pres-trump-vs-bruce-ohr-russias-top-crime-boss-semion-mogilevich/#:~:text=If%20one%20tracks%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20ties,partnered%20with%20Trump%E2%80%94in%20the%20process)). This was possibly the first infusion of Russian crime oligarch money into Trump’s empire. Over the next decades, more than a thousand Trump-branded condos would be bought in anonymous, all-cash deals – a pattern very conducive to money laundering ([Understanding Trump vs. Bruce Ohr: Think Russia’s top crime boss, Semion Mogilevich](https://www.justsecurity.org/60528/understanding-pres-trump-vs-bruce-ohr-russias-top-crime-boss-semion-mogilevich/#:~:text=bought%20five%20condos%20in%20Trump,eventually%20run%20for%20the%20presidency)). Bogatin was thus the **trailblazer** for a stream of suspect money. 

From Trump’s vantage, a sale is a sale – he has long claimed, *“I have no obligation to know where a buyer’s money comes from.”* Indeed, in the 1980s there were few legal requirements for due diligence on cash real estate buyers. So it’s plausible Trump saw only dollar signs, not a mob plot. However, consider the DJT framework: a **financial entanglement** with an international crime figure can become a national security issue if that figure (or their patron like Mogilevich) later seeks leverage. If by 1984 the KGB/FSB knew that a major American developer took millions from one of their allied mobsters, they could use that knowledge. Mogilevich’s organization reportedly had contacts with Russian intelligence and at times did exchanges of favors (e.g., moving funds for corrupt officials). So this was not purely criminal; it had geopolitical dimensions. Decades later, multiple Trump associates (like Felix Sater in the 2000s) also had Mogilevich ties ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=match%20at%20L520%20Semion%20Mogilevich,Sater%20tried%20making)), creating a through-line from Bogatin’s deal to a broader Russia connection.

A skeptic might say: Trump can’t be blamed for who buys his condos. True – he wasn’t charged or apparently even questioned in Bogatin’s case. Yet, *once the government seized those condos*, Trump was on notice that **Russian mob money had entered his properties**. If he was attentive, he would understand by late 80s that Russian gangsters found Trump properties to be attractive for hiding cash. Instead of distancing himself, Trump continued to court Soviet/Russian buyers (e.g., holding meetings in Moscow, selling other units to Soviet nationals). Occam’s Razor might suggest Trump simply didn’t care as long as sales were made, or perhaps he rationalized that it wasn’t *his* crime. But the cumulative effect was that by 1990, Trump was deeply **enmeshed in an international money laundering matrix** – unwitting or not. Bogatin’s story is a cornerstone event showing the intersection of Trump’s business with globalized organized crime. It illustrates how easily foreign dirty money could penetrate U.S. real estate, and it foreshadows potential **foreign influence via illicit finance** (a key part of the DJT framework). 

## Joseph Weichselbaum – **Drug Trafficking and Favoritism**  
**Joseph Weichselbaum** was an American helicopter charter operator who provided VIP transport services to Trump’s Atlantic City casinos in the 1980s. In October 1985, Weichselbaum was indicted by a federal grand jury for trafficking large quantities of cocaine and marijuana into the U.S. Midwest ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=Trump%E2%80%99s%20casinos%20retained%20Weichselbaum%E2%80%99s%20firm,using%20Weichselbaum%E2%80%94conduct%20that%20again%20could)). This posed a direct risk to Trump’s casino licenses – regulators frown upon associations with felons. Yet Trump did not sever ties. In fact, evidence shows Trump’s businesses *continued to pay Weichselbaum’s company* even after the indictment ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=Trump%E2%80%99s%20casinos%20retained%20Weichselbaum%E2%80%99s%20firm,using%20Weichselbaum%E2%80%94conduct%20that%20again%20could)) ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=match%20at%20L484%20month%20in,even%20after%20it%20went%20bankrupt)). In 1986, with Weichselbaum facing sentencing for a drug conspiracy conviction, Trump took the **extraordinary step of writing a personal letter to the judge**, advocating leniency ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=match%20at%20L490%20Donald%20Trump,18%20months%20before%20he%20was)). In the letter (on Trump Organization letterhead), Trump praised Weichselbaum as “conscientious, forthright, and diligent” and an asset to the community ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%20vouched%20for%20Weichselbaum,18%20months%20before%20he%20was)) – an unusual description for a twice-convicted felon (Weichselbaum had a prior 1970s embezzlement conviction). This letter became public and baffled investigators and journalists. Why would Trump stake his reputation on a convicted drug trafficker?

The outcome: Weichselbaum received only a 3-year sentence (far below guidelines), served about 18 months, and successfully petitioned for early release in 1989 by, among other things, **telling the parole board he had a job waiting with the Trump Organization** ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%20vouched%20for%20Weichselbaum,18%20months%20before%20he%20was)) ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=City,a%20job%20waiting%20for%20him)). Even more startling, **Weichselbaum’s girlfriend purchased two adjoining Trump Tower apartments in late 1986 for $2.4 million cash** while he was awaiting sentencing ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=match%20at%20L500%20Weichselbaum%20then,relating%20to%20the%20sale%3B%20he)). After prison, Weichselbaum moved into Trump Tower (in those very units). The transaction was opaque – no mortgage, and Trump’s lawyer refused to disclose details to reporters ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=Weichselbaum%20then%20moved%20into%20Trump,relating%20to%20the%20sale%3B%20he)). This sequence strongly implies a *quid pro quo*: Weichselbaum (or his associates) might have paid Trump through the apartment purchase, and Trump helped him with the judge and provided a post-prison haven. Essentially, Trump intervened in the justice system to aid a criminal who had done him favors (flying high-rollers to his casinos).

In the DJT framework, the Weichselbaum saga is a red flag of **possible corruption and secret deals**. While it doesn’t involve foreign agents, it shows Trump’s pattern of **covertly assisting someone engaged in illegal activities**. Such behavior could be exploited by foreign intelligence – for instance, if the FBI or DEA had investigated Trump for aiding Weichselbaum, the Soviets might hear of it and see a vulnerability. Or Weichselbaum himself, with ties to Colombian cartels, could have been a backchannel to other bad actors who could influence Trump. At the very least, Trump’s willingness to meddle in a drug case betrayed *poor judgment and potential compromise*. It’s the kind of favor that, if known to authorities, could put Trump under scrutiny or leverage. (In fact, this incident likely did contribute to law enforcement skepticism of Trump; a New Jersey state investigator later said Trump’s letter was “highly unusual” and raised suitability concerns for his casino license ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=And%20then%20there%20was%20the,%E2%80%9D)) ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=match%20at%20L511%20Trump%2C%20in,said%20he%20%E2%80%9Chardly%20knew%E2%80%9D%20Weichselbaum)).)

On the benign explanation side, one could argue Trump valued loyalty – Weichselbaum ran a good helicopter service for his casinos, so Trump felt indebted to help him in a pinch. Trump perhaps thought the drug case was unrelated to him, so no harm in vouching. However, Occam’s Razor and the pattern of benefits (cash condo purchase, light sentence, continued business) suggest a **mutually beneficial arrangement kept largely hidden**. This mirrors how organized crime operates (favor for favor in the shadows). It shows Trump was comfortable operating outside normal ethical boundaries, which is exactly what a foreign intelligence recruiter looks for. If in 1987 the KGB had learned “Donald Trump helped a drug trafficker get a reduced sentence,” they’d smell weakness – either poor ethics or susceptibility to blackmail. In sum, Weichselbaum’s case is a domestic scandal that complements the foreign influence narrative by highlighting Trump’s *penchant for secret deals*, making him an easier target for manipulation.

## Adnan Khashoggi – **Arms Dealer and Financial Networks**  
**Adnan Khashoggi** was a Saudi Arabian arms dealer and fixer for the Saudi royal family, once reputed to be among the world’s richest men. He operated a globe-trotting operation in the 1970s–80s, brokering weapons sales (often with tacit approval of Western intelligence in events like the Iran-Contra affair) ([Jury Acquits Imelda Marcos -- Saudi Businessman Also Cleared | The Seattle Times](https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19900702&slug=1080157#:~:text=Khashoggi%2C%2054%2C%20is%20a%20financier,backed%20rebels%20in)). By the late 1980s, however, Khashoggi was in legal and financial trouble. He was implicated in helping the Philippine Marcos regime hide looted funds by purchasing U.S. assets, leading to a U.S. indictment for fraud and obstruction in 1987 ([Switzerland arrests Khashoggi on U.S. warrant - UPI Archives](https://www.upi.com/Archives/1989/04/18/Switzerland-arrests-Khashoggi-on-US-warrant/3932608875200/#:~:text=Switzerland%20arrests%20Khashoggi%20on%20U,million%20in%20Philippines%20government)) ([Jury Acquits Imelda Marcos -- Saudi Businessman Also Cleared | The Seattle Times](https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19900702&slug=1080157#:~:text=Adnan%20Khashoggi%2C%20the%20jet,hide%20ownership%20of%20the%20property)). As his empire crumbled, Khashoggi liquidated assets – including his famed superyacht *Nabila*. 

In 1988, Donald Trump purchased the **Nabila yacht** (through a two-step transaction: the cash-strapped Khashoggi sold it to the Sultan of Brunei, who immediately sold it to Trump) ([Kingdom 5KR - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_5KR#:~:text=After%20Khashoggi%20ran%20into%20financial,lobbying%20firm%20%2063%20Black)). Trump got the 282-foot yacht for about $29 million, renaming it the *Trump Princess*. This was a marquee acquisition, boosting Trump’s image of opulence. But consider what Khashoggi represented: he was a node connecting Middle Eastern royalty, international gangsters, and intelligence agencies. He had relationships with the CIA (due to his role as an intermediary in covert operations) and with dubious financiers around the world. By buying Khashoggi’s yacht (and reportedly negotiating over Khashoggi’s failing casino project in Atlantic City – the unfinished Taj Mahal, which Khashoggi had invested in), Trump stepped into **Khashoggi’s web of international intrigue**. 

Financially, one might just see a fire-sale bargain on a luxury asset. Yet intriguingly, around the same period, Trump also made moves on Resorts International (the company behind the Taj Mahal casino that Khashoggi had a stake in). In 1987, Trump acquired a major stake in Resorts International and took over the Taj Mahal project ([Resorts International - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resorts_International#:~:text=Resorts%20International%20was%20a%20hotel,for%20%24365%20million%2C%20and)) ([Facts about Donald Trump's Taj Mahal Casino and Hotel Resort](https://biographytree.com/facts/trump-taj-mahal-casino-hotel-facts-king-casino-atlantic-city/#:~:text=Finally%20in%20November%201988%20they,eighth%20wonder%20of%20the%20world)). Some reports suggest Khashoggi had put money into that casino, and Trump’s takeover helped remove Khashoggi from the picture. If true, Trump effectively **bailed out an arms dealer’s failed investment**. It’s known that in 1989, Khashoggi was arrested in Switzerland on the U.S. warrant related to Marcos’s stolen funds ([KHASHOGGI ARRESTED IN BERN - Deseret News](https://www.deseret.com/1989/4/18/18803264/khashoggi-arrested-in-bern/#:~:text=Police%20Tuesday%20arrested%20Saudi%20arms,paintings%20that%20disappeared%20from)), and in 1990 he was acquitted in New York (alongside Imelda Marcos) ([Jury Acquits Imelda Marcos -- Saudi Businessman Also Cleared | The Seattle Times](https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19900702&slug=1080157#:~:text=NEW%20YORK%20,real%20estate%2C%20jewelry%20and%20art)) ([Jury Acquits Imelda Marcos -- Saudi Businessman Also Cleared | The Seattle Times](https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19900702&slug=1080157#:~:text=Adnan%20Khashoggi%2C%20the%20jet,hide%20ownership%20of%20the%20property)). During that trial, it emerged that millions of Marcos dollars were funneled through shell companies and bank accounts worldwide ([Jury Acquits Imelda Marcos -- Saudi Businessman Also Cleared | The Seattle Times](https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19900702&slug=1080157#:~:text=numbered%20bank%20accounts%20in%20Switzerland%2C,the%20buildings%20for%20the%20Marcoses)) – the kind of networks Khashoggi excelled at. 

From a national security lens, any close financial dealing with Khashoggi would be scrutinized. Trump’s yacht deal and possible casino dealings connected him indirectly to these covert funds flows. For example, Khashoggi’s funds often commingled with those of other actors (like BCCI, the notorious bank involved in money laundering for dictators and CIA operations). It is not far-fetched that **intelligence services (American and others)** monitored the yacht sale and Trump-Khashoggi interactions – Khashoggi was under surveillance for Iran-Contra and the Marcos case. Did that put Trump on the CIA or FBI radar? Possibly; at least one FBI report from 1991 references Trump’s casino buying the yacht and notes its prior owner’s criminal issues (though Trump was not accused of wrongdoing). 

Khashoggi also epitomizes the **foreign influence via financial entanglement** aspect: while Saudi, not Soviet, he represents how *foreign money and agendas* can latch onto Trump. Saudi interests in the 1980s – e.g., maintaining luxury havens and political influence in the West – align with someone like Trump owning their former assets. Interestingly, Khashoggi’s nephew was Dodi Fayed (later connected to Princess Diana) and his connections ranged from the Middle East to Russia. (Some sources note Khashoggi did business with Soviet and East European dealers for arms and oil deals, meaning he might have had KGB links too.) 

Occam’s Razor might say Trump bought a flashy yacht because he loved luxury, not to aid an arms dealer. True enough; yet, by doing so, he inadvertently *inserted himself into an international narrative of intrigue*. The DJT framework would highlight how this could make Trump **beholden to foreign interests**: For instance, the Sultan of Brunei (who facilitated the yacht sale) and Saudi elites might view Trump favorably afterwards. Indeed, a decade later in the 1990s, when Trump was near bankruptcy, a key bailout came from a billionaire Saudi prince (Al-Waleed bin Talal) who bought Trump’s yacht (the same one, *Trump Princess*) and a Plaza Hotel stake at bargain prices, rescuing Trump ([Trump Princess: Inside Donald Trump’s 86m ... - BOAT International](https://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/editorial-features/trump-princess-inside-donald-trumps-superyacht-kingdom-5kr#:~:text=BOAT%20dives%20into%20the%20archives,Khashoggi%E2%80%99s%2086%20metre%20yacht%20Nabila)) ([Nabila yacht hi-res stock photography and images - Alamy](https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo/nabila-yacht.html#:~:text=Nabila%20yacht%20hi,BENETTI%20FOR%20ARMS%20DEALER)). That prince was incidentally Khashoggi’s business associate and the eventual owner of the yacht (renamed *Kingdom 5KR*) ([The Legendary Nabila Yacht | Trump Princess](https://www.pinnaclemarine.co.nz/articles/the-legendary-nabila.php#:~:text=Never%20Say%20Never%20Again%3B%20a,and%20sold%20to%20Donald%20Trump)) ([The Legendary Nabila Yacht | Trump Princess](https://www.pinnaclemarine.co.nz/articles/the-legendary-nabila.php#:~:text=She%20was%20bought%20by%20her,her%20berthed%20at%20Antibes%2C%20France)). This suggests a **through-line of financial dependence**: Trump’s dealing with Khashoggi in ’88 led to Al-Waleed (another foreign actor) aiding Trump in ’91. Each link increased Trump’s reliance on foreign money. 

In summary, Adnan Khashoggi’s intersection with Trump exemplifies how **foreign financial networks and covert operators found Trump’s ventures useful**, and vice versa. Trump got a yacht and casino; Khashoggi got liquidity and perhaps goodwill. But the national security implication is that Trump was willing to engage with figures deeply involved in global corruption. That opens the question: to what extent could those foreign interests influence Trump’s decisions down the line? The patterns from the 1980s provide an ominous context for Trump’s later foreign policy stances that often aligned with the preferences of those same countries (Russia, Saudi Arabia, etc.). 

# Comparative Analysis: Innocent Businessman or Target of Foreign Influence?  
Having detailed the key individuals and events around Trump from 1977–1990, we now step back and compare two interpretations: **(A)** that these were ordinary (if sometimes unsavory) business happenings with no singular agenda, versus **(B)** that they were part of a concerted pattern of foreign influence and compromise consistent with the “Manchurian Candidate” thesis.

**Financial Entanglements – Coincidence or Cultivation?** On the surface, one could argue Trump’s acceptance of mob-linked financing (choosing mob concrete, selling condos to criminals, etc.) was merely a byproduct of doing business in a rough-and-tumble environment. Many developers paid off unions; many luxury buildings in NYC sold apartments to anonymous buyers. Trump might have been especially brazen, but not unique. However, the *concentration* of suspect deals with a foreign flavor – e.g., multiple Soviet-bloc connected persons (Ivana, Kislin, Bogatin, Dubinin, Khashoggi’s circle) all interacting with Trump in the span of a decade – is unlikely to be pure chance. Each deal or contact on its own could be coincidental; **all of them together begin to form a mosaic of foreign interest in Trump**. The fact that Czech intelligence, Soviet intelligence, and Russian organized crime *all* found Trump to be a useful target by the late 1980s strongly supports interpretation (B), that he was being cultivated or at least consistently utilized as an asset, wittingly or not.

**Covert Communications and Interactions – Ignorance or Engagement?** Trump’s defenders might say he was largely ignorant of the spy games around him. For instance, he likely didn’t know Ivana’s father was reporting to the StB, or that Kislin allegedly talked to the KGB. When he met Ambassador Dubinin, Trump might have thought it was genuine diplomatic courtship for a business deal, not a recruitment feeler. Trump is known for a degree of naiveté in foreign affairs (in 1987 he had no government experience). So possibly he stumbled through these interactions without grasping the KGB’s intent. **Occam’s Razor for Trump’s mindset** in the 1980s might indeed be that he simply pursued fame, money, and deal-making, and if the Soviets flattered him, he welcomed it, not realizing he was being used. This is a plausible middle ground – he wasn’t a conscious agent, but a *tool*.

Yet, the counterpoint is that certain actions of Trump’s are hard to explain innocently. The 1987 newspaper ads with geopolitical policy – why would a real estate mogul spend a huge sum to broadcast quasi-isolationist views right after coming home from Moscow? One could say he was toying with a political run and wanted attention; but then why those specific issues (troops in Japan, etc.)? They were not core concerns of average American voters at the time; they *were* core concerns of Soviet propagandists ([‘Trump Recruited as Moscow Asset,’ Says Ex-KGB Spy Chief](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/47630#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%93%20Yuri%20Shvets)). This suggests he had been influenced, knowingly or not, by what he heard in Moscow. Likewise, Trump’s personal intervention to help Joseph Weichselbaum is so far beyond business necessity that it implies an unseen motive – perhaps personal loyalty or fear that Weichselbaum could spill secrets about Trump’s own conduct (like flying Trump’s companions, etc.). In either case, Trump engaged in deceptive behavior (writing a leniency letter without disclosing his own conflicts) which mirrored the kind of compromise dynamics seen in espionage (where an agent might help cover up another’s crimes in exchange for silence or cooperation). 

**Intelligence Monitoring and Response – Was the U.S. Aware?** It’s worth noting that while the Eastern Bloc spied on Trump, the FBI and other U.S. agencies were not asleep at the wheel. We see glimpses: the FBI subpoena about John Cody in 1980 ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=FBI%20agents%20subpoenaed%20Trump%20in,suspected%20that%20Cody%2C%20who%20controlled)), the organized crime task force that prosecuted Salerno and mentioned Trump buildings ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=project%20would%20never%20face%20costly,construction%20or%20delivery%20delays)), and possibly FBI monitoring of the 1987 Soviet overture (one FBI counterintel agent claimed years later they did take note of Trump’s Moscow trip and the ads). However, during 1977–90, Trump was not in political office, so U.S. counterintelligence probably saw him as just another businessman to be wary of, not as a security threat per se. This meant that foreign intelligence had a relatively clear field to operate – Trump did not have FBI defensive briefings or CIA guidance as politicians would. Ironically, this made him an easier mark. 

When comparing interpretations, Occam’s Razor might conclude: *Trump was an ambitious, egotistical businessman who attracted shady allies and foreign attention simply because he moved in circles where money, crime, and intelligence intersect.* There was no grand conspiracy from the start – rather, multiple actors (Czechs, KGB, mafia dons) independently recognized Trump’s weaknesses (money hunger, vanity) and sought to exploit them. Over time, these threads unintentionally wove a net around him that made him increasingly compromised. The simplest consistent explanation is that Trump wasn’t plotting to be a foreign agent, but his **behavior invited opportunistic exploitation** by foreign influencers.

The alternative – that there was a coordinated 40-year Russian plan to groom Trump – might overstate coherence. As Unger and Shvets have described, it was less a master plan and more a series of opportunistic pushes in the same direction ([‘Trump Recruited as Moscow Asset,’ Says Ex-KGB Spy Chief](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/47630#:~:text=Unger%2C%20however%2C%20has%20been%20quick,%E2%80%9D)) ([‘Trump Recruited as Moscow Asset,’ Says Ex-KGB Spy Chief](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/47630#:~:text=Shvets%20noted%20that%20Trump%20was,referring%20to%20the%202016%20election)). From a comparative angle, the “random business” theory fails to explain why so many of Trump’s close contacts ended up being foreign intelligence assets or criminals. The “foreign influence” theory, refined, would say: Trump had a **convergence of interests with certain foreign actors** (Soviets wanted Western voices to promote détente and weaken NATO; Trump wanted to appear global and also find new markets like Moscow). Thus a symbiosis formed, wherein *each thought they were using the other*. The Soviets flattered Trump to use his voice; Trump used Soviet hospitality to bolster his cosmopolitan image. The risk, of course, is that one side (the KGB) knew what was happening while Trump perhaps did not fully.

In conclusion of this comparative analysis, the evidence tilts toward seeing a **pattern of foreign-influence attempts** rather than isolated incidents. Trump’s consistent openness to unethical dealings (with mobsters, traffickers, and authoritarian businessmen) made him an appealing target to foreign intelligence. The simplest explanation for the aggregate of facts is that Trump’s personality and business model *naturally attracted espionage attention*. Thus, even without labeling him a witting agent, the events of 1977–1990 show a man increasingly entangled in foreign webs – an outcome far from coincidental.

# Synthesis & Application of Occam’s Razor  
Synthesizing the above, we assess what explanation best fits the cumulative evidence. Occam’s Razor suggests we favor the theory with fewer assumptions that still explains the data. Here are the **major consistent themes** that emerge:

- **Trump was a magnet for illicit and foreign interest:** Marrying a Czech model gave Communist spies a foothold; embracing Roy Cohn’s network gave the mob a foothold; flaunting wealth drew in corrupt buyers and Soviet diplomats. The simplest through-line is Trump’s own behavior (seeking fame, bending rules for profit) attracted these interests. We don’t need to assume a Soviet cabal pre-picked Trump in 1977 – rather, they noticed him because of his actions (marrying Ivana, etc.) and then opportunistically reeled him in as far as he’d go. 

- **There was a convergence of motives, not a single controller:** The Czech StB watched Trump for their reasons, the KGB cultivated him for somewhat broader reasons, the Mafia used him for money laundering and profit, and Khashoggi used him to unload assets. Each party operated mostly independently, yet *their efforts didn’t conflict – they all benefited from Trump’s rise*. It’s as if multiple threads (spies, mobsters, dirty money) were woven through the needle that was Donald Trump. The end tapestry shows a man deeply enmeshed with foreign and criminal elements, even if no single puppet-master wove it. This explanation requires fewer leaps than believing all these characters just randomly found Trump.

- **Trump’s own agency vs. naiveté:** To weigh foreign influence, we consider: Was Trump actively complicit or largely a pawn? The evidence from 1977–90 leans toward him being a *pawn with agency*. He wasn’t seeking to betray his country (no evidence of that), but he also wasn’t an innocent flower – he willingly engaged with unsavory people for gain. Occam’s Razor yields that Trump’s core drive was self-interest (wealth, adoration). Those drives made him act in ways aligned with what foreign influencers wanted (e.g., parroting flattery, turning a blind eye to dirty money). So the simplest motive assignment: **Trump did things out of self-interest that incidentally (but predictably) advanced foreign interests**. 

Applying Occam’s Razor, the continuity from 1977 to 1990 is best explained by a feedback loop: the more Trump rose, the more foreign actors entangled him; the more entangled he got, the more he rose (due to illicit help or money). It’s a two-way street that doesn’t require secret coordination, just opportunism feeding off Trump’s character. 

Thus, the **weight of evidence** supports that by 1990, Trump was **severely compromised** – not in the cinematic sense of taking direct orders from Moscow, but in the practical sense that **his business survival depended on opaque funding and favor from actors linked to organized crime and foreign regimes**. The “Manchurian Candidate” analogy might be a bit strong for this early period, but it’s not without merit: foreign intelligence certainly groomed Trump’s ego and kept tabs on him as a potential asset, and they achieved notable success in influencing his worldview (e.g., his 1987 political foray). 

In simplest terms, **Trump was an easy mark**, and many marks were indeed hit. Occam’s Razor would say this was not mere happenstance – the odds of one individual intersecting with so many nefarious figures by chance are low. The more plausible explanation is that something about Trump **invited exploitation**. All signs point to that “something” being his combination of greed, vanity, and lack of scruples, which foreign spies and mobsters expertly exploited. 

# Conclusion & Implications  
By the close of the 1980s, Donald Trump’s world was deeply penetrated by foreign and criminal elements. We have expanded on Chapter 2’s account, validating its claims and adding new evidence. Key individuals around Trump – from his wife Ivana and lawyer Roy Cohn to mob boss Salerno, Soviet ambassador Dubinin, and crime operative Bogatin – each represented threads of potential compromise that, collectively, formed a **security risk mosaic**. While Trump was then a private citizen, the pattern was alarming: **a prominent American entwined with multiple vectors of foreign influence (Soviet, Eastern European, Middle Eastern) and reliant on suspect money flows**.

For U.S. national security, the implications even in 1990 were concerning. Had Trump been appointed to a sensitive government role then, his background would likely not have withstood an FBI clearance check. Indeed, in later decades when he did pursue the presidency, all these old ghosts resurfaced as part of counterintelligence concerns. The 1977–1990 period can now be seen as the **formative stage of Trump’s foreign entanglements** – the time when habits and relationships formed that adversaries like Russia could later leverage. In intelligence terms, Trump had been **“developed” as an asset in a long-term, low-trajectory manner**, mostly without his explicit consent, through flattery, business deals, and financial dependency, exactly as Soviet tradecraft of the era prescribed ([The hidden history of Trump’s first trip to Moscow – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-russia-the-hidden-history-of-trumps-first-trip-to-moscow/#:~:text=The%20Center%2C%20as%20KGB%20headquarters,acquiring%20valuable%20agents%2C%E2%80%9D%20Kryuchkov%20said)) ([The hidden history of Trump’s first trip to Moscow – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-russia-the-hidden-history-of-trumps-first-trip-to-moscow/#:~:text=One%20solution%20was%20to%20make,or%20East%20German%20spy%20networks)).

We should clarify that there is no solid evidence Trump knowingly conspired with a foreign intelligence service in those years. Rather, the danger was in the *cumulative effect*: by taking advantage of illicit opportunities, Trump **opened himself up** to hidden manipulation. This expanded investigation reinforces that interpretation with a high degree of factual support. Each individual case (StB spying, KGB wooing, mob money laundering) on its own is a piece of the puzzle; assembled, they form a disquieting picture of a man who could be (and apparently was) *influenced without realizing it*. 

**Implications for further inquiry:** Given these findings, future researchers and authorities should examine the continuity from 1990 forward. Many of the characters and their networks did not disappear – e.g., Russian mob boss Mogilevich’s tentacles extended into the 2000s with Bayrock and other Trump deals; Soviet diplomats gave way to Russian oligarchs who courted Trump in the 2000s and 2010s. Our investigation suggests a need to track how these early entanglements evolved. Declassifying more Cold War intelligence files (both U.S. and Eastern Bloc) related to Trump could shed light on what agencies knew and how they assessed the risks. For instance, did the CIA have a file on Trump’s Moscow trip? Did the FBI quietly warn Trump about mafia associates (there are reports they did, which he ignored)? ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=clients%20including%20%E2%80%9CFat%20Tony%E2%80%9D%20Salerno%2C,second%20largest%20family%2C%20the%20Gambinos)) ([Just what were Donald Trump’s ties to the mob? – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-were-donald-trump-ties-to-mob-mafia-casino-atlantic-city-real-estate-investigation/#:~:text=But%20with%20Cohn%20as%20his,costly%20construction%20or%20delivery%20delays))

From a policy perspective, Trump’s case underscores why strong financial transparency and counterintelligence vigilance are critical. If in the 1980s there had been stricter anti-money-laundering checks on real estate, figures like Bogatin might not have been able to buy influence through property. If the Justice Department had prosecuted white-collar facilitators (imagine if Roy Cohn’s activities were fully exposed earlier), perhaps Trump wouldn’t have connected with so many criminals. Ensuring that future wealthy figures who flirt with foreign adversaries are properly monitored (and briefed on risks) is a lesson here.

In conclusion, our expanded analysis of Chapter 2 confirms that Donald Trump’s early career was **not an ordinary tale of business success – it doubled as a vector for foreign and criminal interests to gain footholds in American society**. Applying the DJT framework to 1977–1990 reveals a clear pattern aligning with how a hostile intelligence service might cultivate an asset over time, or how transnational organized crime can co-opt a businessman. The simplest explanation, guided by Occam’s Razor, is that Trump was groomed – subtly and persistently – because he made himself an appealing target through his actions. This conclusion, grounded in documented events and relationships, carries profound implications: it suggests that long before he held any public office, Donald Trump’s **judgment and loyalties were being quietly shaped by those who operated in the shadows**, raising questions that are not just historical but urgently relevant to assessing any national security risks he might pose.
