# Donald Trump’s Financial Dealings (1986–1989)

**Introduction:** The late 1980s marked the height of Donald Trump’s first real estate empire – a period of rapid expansion into high-profile properties, coupled with complex financing and mounting debt. Between 1986 and 1989, Trump acquired marquee hotels and casinos, courted foreign investors, fought high-stakes legal battles, and engaged in bold (sometimes risky) financial maneuvers. This report analyzes Trump’s major real estate acquisitions and investments during that period, his international financial ties, the legal and regulatory scrutiny he faced, unusual transactions that raised red flags, and how his public statements compared to insider accounts and financial records. The picture that emerges is one of aggressive growth and showmanship shadowed by debt, legal challenges, and questions about the sustainability of his business practices.

## Real Estate Acquisitions & Investments (1986–1989)

Trump’s **real estate portfolio** grew dramatically in the late 1980s, as he acquired trophy assets in New York and expanded his casino holdings in Atlantic City:

- **Atlantic City Casinos:** Trump entered the Atlantic City gambling market in the 1980s and, by the late ’80s, owned three casino hotels. In 1985 he acquired the failing Atlantic City Hilton and reopened it as **Trump’s Castle** (later Trump Marina) ([How the Atlantic City Disaster Set Trump up to Pay No Taxes for Years - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-atlantic-city-disaster-casinos-hotels-trump-pay-no-taxes-2020-10#:~:text=Trump%27s%20Atlantic%20City%20casino%20business,casino%20crown%2C%20the%20Taj%20Mahal)). In 1986, he *bought out Holiday Inn’s share* of the **Trump Plaza Hotel & Casino**, gaining full ownership of that property ([How the Atlantic City Disaster Set Trump up to Pay No Taxes for Years - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-atlantic-city-disaster-casinos-hotels-trump-pay-no-taxes-2020-10#:~:text=Trump%27s%20Atlantic%20City%20casino%20business,casino%20crown%2C%20the%20Taj%20Mahal)). His biggest bet was the **Trump Taj Mahal**, a mega-casino project he obtained in 1988 after a takeover battle for Resorts International (the previous developer). Trump struck a deal with media mogul Merv Griffin, wherein **Trump took control of the half-finished Taj Mahal** and Griffin took other Resorts assets ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=They%20shook%20on%20it,though%2C%20they%20had%20a%20deal)). Trump agreed to pay around $300 million for the Taj while Griffin bought out Trump’s stake in Resorts for $63 million ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=They%20shook%20on%20it,though%2C%20they%20had%20a%20deal)). When it opened in April 1990, the Taj Mahal was billed as the “eighth wonder of the world” and the most expensive casino ever built at **$1.1 billion** total cost ([Business career of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_career_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=Later%20in%201988%2C%20Trump%20acquired,alternative%20proposal%20to%20scrap%20Trump%27s)). Trump’s casino investments made him a dominant player in Atlantic City, but they were heavily financed and soon under pressure.

- **Major Manhattan Properties:** Trump also set new records in New York. In 1988 he purchased the legendary **Plaza Hotel** in Manhattan for **$407.5 million**, an unprecedented sum for a hotel at the time ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=That%20spring%2C%20though%2C%20he%20purchased,debt%20to%20which%20Trump%20committed)). He openly **overpaid** – later admitting, “I have knowingly made a deal which was not economic,” calling the Plaza a “masterpiece” he just couldn’t resist ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=Trump%20must%20have%20known%20because,the%20Plaza%2C%E2%80%9D%20read%20the%20title)). Trump financed the Plaza **almost entirely with debt**, taking out a $425 million mortgage from a bank group led by Citicorp and **personally guaranteeing $125 million** of it ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=He%20funded%20the%20purchase%20and,guaranteed%20%24125%20million%20of%20it)). Industry observers ridiculed the purchase as financially unsound, noting that the **Plaza’s cash flow couldn’t even cover the interest payments** unless every room was filled year-round at rates far above market levels ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDonald%E2%80%99s%20purchase%20of%20the%20Plaza,biography%20of%20Trump%2C%20Lost%20Tycoon)). (Indeed, two years later the Plaza hit financial trouble and was restructured under bankruptcy protection, with Trump ceding a 49% stake to his lenders to reduce the debt burden ([Donald Trump bluffed his way out of bankruptcy in the 90s — will ...](https://nypost.com/2024/01/11/news/how-donald-trump-bluffed-his-way-out-of-bankruptcy-in-the-90s/#:~:text=,to%20finance%20the%20purchase)) ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20only%20way%20the%20Plaza,started%20at%20%24195%20a%20night)).) 

- **Other Investments:** Trump’s ambitions extended beyond real estate into transportation and mega-projects. In 1989 he acquired Eastern Airlines’ shuttle operation (the Boston-New York-Washington air shuttle), rebranding it the **Trump Shuttle**, in a **$365 million** deal financed mostly with loans ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=And%20in%20the%20fall%2C%20he,thought%20the%20shuttle%20was%20worth)). He also spent lavishly on personal assets with business overtones – for example, **in 1987 he bought the 282-foot megayacht “Nabila”** (renaming it the Trump Princess) from the Sultan of Brunei for about **$29 million**, after its previous owner, Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, ran into financial trouble ([The full story behind the yachts of Trump and his cabinet - Yacht Harbour](https://yachtharbour.com/news/the-full-story-behind-the-yachts-of-trump-and-his-cabinet-2294#:~:text=Image)). Trump touted the yacht as a business tool (for entertaining hotel high-rollers and hosting charitable events) ([The full story behind the yachts of Trump and his cabinet - Yacht Harbour](https://yachtharbour.com/news/the-full-story-behind-the-yachts-of-trump-and-his-cabinet-2294#:~:text=name%20from%20Nabila%2C%20Khashoggi%27s%20daughter)). In New York, he proposed an enormous West Side development (dubbed “Trump City” on the old rail yards) with the world’s tallest building, reflecting his grandiose vision ([Business career of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_career_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=following%20year.,before%20his%20own%20plan%20could)) – but that project stalled amid community and regulatory resistance. By 1989, Trump’s empire included upscale **properties in New York (office towers, luxury condos, the Plaza Hotel), casinos in New Jersey, an airline, a yacht**, and other ventures, all of which heightened his profile as a bold developer. However, these acquisitions were *highly leveraged*, making Trump’s fortunes increasingly vulnerable to economic downturns and high interest payments.

## International Financial Ties

During 1986–1989, Trump’s business activities showed **numerous international linkages**, through both investments and investors:

- **Japanese Financing and Buyers:** In the 1980s, Japan’s booming economy led Japanese investors to snap up U.S. real estate, and Trump capitalized on this trend. He **built his real estate empire in part with Japanese money**, both by borrowing from Japanese banks and by selling luxury properties to Japanese buyers ([Long before bashing China on trade, Trump teed off on Japan - The World from PRX](https://theworld.org/stories/2019/05/24/long-bashing-china-trade-trump-tee-japan#:~:text=But%20there%20have%20been%20contradictions,real%20estate%20to%20Japanese%20buyers)). For example, Trump Tower condos and other units were purchased by foreign investors willing to pay top dollar, contributing to Trump’s net worth. Trump often railed publicly against Japan’s trade practices in the ’80s, yet he privately benefited from their cash infusion into U.S. real estate ([Long before bashing China on trade, Trump teed off on Japan - The World from PRX](https://theworld.org/stories/2019/05/24/long-bashing-china-trade-trump-tee-japan#:~:text=%E2%80%9CYet%2C%20at%20the%20exact%20same,%E2%80%9D)). His blunt acknowledgement of how much he relied on foreign buyers came in a 1989 **Time magazine** interview: Asked to estimate his own wealth, Trump quipped **“Who knows? I mean, really, who knows how much the Japs will pay for Manhattan property these days?”** ([Former Tampa Mayor Sandy Freedman recalls Donald Trump's eye-opening 1988 visit](https://www.tampabay.com/sandy-freedman-recalls-an-eye-opening-visit-to-tampa-by-donald-trump-in/2281171/#:~:text=The%20term%20did%2C%20however%2C%20appear,about%20his%20wealth%20and%20worth)). This crass remark underscored that the sky-high valuations of his assets – and thus his fortune – depended on international (in this case Japanese) investors’ eagerness to buy. 

- **Soviet/Russian Connections:** Trump’s first significant foray abroad was toward the *Soviet Union*. In July 1987, he and his wife Ivana traveled to Moscow at the invitation of Soviet officials to explore building a Trump luxury hotel in Moscow ([The Hidden History of Trump’s First Trip to Moscow - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/19/trump-first-moscow-trip-215842#:~:text=By%20January%201987%2C%20Trump%20was,American%20assistant)) ([The Hidden History of Trump’s First Trip to Moscow - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/19/trump-first-moscow-trip-215842#:~:text=According%20to%20The%20Art%20of,and%20the%20state%20Hermitage%20museum)). The Soviets **flew him in and showed him potential sites near Red Square**, hoping to attract Western investment. Trump was impressed with their ambition and scouted a half-dozen sites, according to his own account in *The Art of the Deal* ([The Hidden History of Trump’s First Trip to Moscow - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/19/trump-first-moscow-trip-215842#:~:text=According%20to%20The%20Art%20of,and%20the%20state%20Hermitage%20museum)). Ultimately, **no deal materialized** – the Moscow hotel idea fell through, as would subsequent attempts to expand into Russia ([The Hidden History of Trump’s First Trip to Moscow - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/19/trump-first-moscow-trip-215842#:~:text=Nothing%20came%20of%20the%20trip%E2%80%94at,mayor%20or%20governor%20or%20senator)). However, the 1987 trip was significant as an early sign of Trump’s interest in foreign projects and it put him on the Kremlin’s radar. (Notably, security experts have since suggested that the Soviet intelligence service closely observed Trump during this visit, though Trump was not known to have any business operations in the USSR at the time ([The Hidden History of Trump’s First Trip to Moscow - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/19/trump-first-moscow-trip-215842#:~:text=Moscow%20was%2C%20Trump%20wrote%2C%20%E2%80%9Can,suite%20would%20have%20been%20bugged)) ([The Hidden History of Trump’s First Trip to Moscow - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/19/trump-first-moscow-trip-215842#:~:text=The%20KGB%E2%80%99s%20private%20dossier%20on,including%20anything%20gleaned%20via%20eavesdropping)).) Trump returned from Moscow voicing newfound political aspirations – shortly after the trip, he took out newspaper ads criticizing U.S. foreign policy and hinting at a future presidential run ([The Hidden History of Trump’s First Trip to Moscow - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/19/trump-first-moscow-trip-215842#:~:text=Nothing%20came%20of%20the%20trip%E2%80%94at,mayor%20or%20governor%20or%20senator)).

- **Middle Eastern and Other Foreign Ties:** Trump’s businesses also intersected with Middle Eastern money in this era. The most visible example was his deal with **Adnan Khashoggi**, a Saudi billionaire infamous for arms dealing. Trump’s purchase of Khashoggi’s luxury yacht in 1987 (via the Sultan of Brunei) for $29 million gave him a direct connection to a key Middle Eastern figure ([The full story behind the yachts of Trump and his cabinet - Yacht Harbour](https://yachtharbour.com/news/the-full-story-behind-the-yachts-of-trump-and-his-cabinet-2294#:~:text=Image)). A year later, in 1988, Khashoggi was indicted in the U.S. on fraud and other charges related to the Marcos regime, illustrating the risky reputational territory of dealing with such international characters. Trump himself was not implicated, but the yacht transaction showed his willingness to do business with those involved in global intrigue. Moreover, as Trump’s financial situation worsened by 1990, he looked overseas for buyers: he even tried (unsuccessfully) to sell the Trump Princess yacht to Japanese investors, and **ultimately sold it to Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal in 1991** to raise cash ([Long before bashing China on trade, Trump teed off on Japan - The World from PRX](https://theworld.org/stories/2019/05/24/long-bashing-china-trade-trump-tee-japan#:~:text=Trump%20also%20sought%20that%20investment,his%20yacht%2C%20The%20Trump%20Princess)) ([Long before bashing China on trade, Trump teed off on Japan - The World from PRX](https://theworld.org/stories/2019/05/24/long-bashing-china-trade-trump-tee-japan#:~:text=Perhaps%20it%E2%80%99s%20no%20huge%20surprise,to%20a%20Saudi%20prince%20instead)). 

- **Global Capital Flows in Real Estate:** Trump’s late-’80s projects were funded by a web of global finance. Banks from **Japan, Australia, and Europe participated in syndicates** lending to his projects, attracted by the prestige of Trump’s deals despite their risks ([Long before bashing China on trade, Trump teed off on Japan - The World from PRX](https://theworld.org/stories/2019/05/24/long-bashing-china-trade-trump-tee-japan#:~:text=%E2%80%9CYet%2C%20at%20the%20exact%20same,%E2%80%9D)). When he later sought rescue for his over-extended West Side project in the early ’90s, he struck a deal with investors from Hong Kong to inject $90 million ([Business career of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_career_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=challenged%20Trump%20Shuttle%20%20airline,after%20having%20to%20file%20for)) – further evidence that foreign capital was a lifeline for his ventures. In sum, while Trump cast himself as an all-American mogul, his enterprises in 1986–89 had increasingly **international entanglements** – from Asian banks and Middle Eastern magnates to prospective deals in Moscow. These ties brought in much-needed funds and buyers, but also raised questions about potential foreign influence and the source of funds flowing into his projects.

## Legal Disputes & Regulatory Scrutiny

Trump’s aggressive business moves in the late 1980s led to numerous **legal battles and regulatory investigations**. Key instances include:

- **USFL Antitrust Lawsuit (1986):** One of Trump’s earliest high-profile legal clashes came from sports, not real estate. As the owner of the New Jersey Generals football team in the upstart USFL, Trump spearheaded an antitrust suit against the NFL. In 1986, the USFL technically *won* the case but was awarded only **$1 in damages (tripled to $3)** – a humiliating outcome that drove the USFL to fold ([Business career of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_career_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=match%20at%20L853%20The%20Generals,to%20just%207%20active%20franchises)). In a scathing 1988 opinion, a federal judge blamed the USFL’s demise on its own missteps – “notably Donald Trump” – saying Trump **“unwisely and impatiently”** pushed the league to play games in the fall head-to-head against the NFL, a strategy likened to a **“victim’s suicide”** ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=A%20federal%20appeals%20court%20affirmed,%E2%80%9D)). This legal defeat highlighted Trump’s risk-taking style and foreshadowed the combative approach he would bring to other arenas. (Trump shrugged off the loss, but many observers felt his overbearing tactics effectively sabotaged the USFL.)

- **Resorts International Takeover Battle (1987–88):** In 1987, Trump set his sights on Resorts International, the company whose assets included the unfinished Taj Mahal casino. He quietly accumulated stock and made a lowball buyout offer of $15 per share for Resorts, prompting accusations that he was trying to **depress the stock price through negative remarks** and swoop in cheaply ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=He%20tried%20to%20take%20private,assist%20from%20an%20independent%20investment)). New Jersey casino regulators took notice – during hearings, **commissioners said Trump’s testimony was “laced with hyperbole, contradictions and generalities,”** and some suspected a scheme to manipulate the stock ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=struggling%20city,impulsive%20than%20that%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said)). Trump raised his offer to $22, but then billionaire Merv Griffin entered the fray with a higher bid, leading to a dramatic **bidding war and legal skirmishes** in 1988. Rather than fight to the bitter end, Trump and Griffin negotiated a truce: Trump would get the Taj Mahal he coveted, while Griffin would take over Resorts International’s other casinos and assets ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=They%20shook%20on%20it,though%2C%20they%20had%20a%20deal)). The **verbal agreement** they struck in April 1988 (famously sealed with a handshake in Trump’s office) had Trump paying around $300 million for the Taj and relinquishing his management interest in Resorts for a payout ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=They%20shook%20on%20it,though%2C%20they%20had%20a%20deal)). They “sparred in the press” for months thereafter and finalized the deal by fall 1988 ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=Trump%20would%20pay%20Griffin%20a,though%2C%20they%20had%20a%20deal)). This episode saw Trump both suing and negotiating behind closed doors – a testament to his willingness to use **litigation as leverage in business negotiations**.

- **Casino Licensing and Investigations:** As Trump’s casino empire grew, so did **regulatory scrutiny** from New Jersey authorities charged with ensuring casinos’ financial stability and integrity. The Casino Control Commission and Division of Gaming Enforcement reviewed Trump’s finances in detail during license applications and expansion plans. By 1989, regulators were openly concerned that Trump’s highly leveraged projects might collapse. Reports surfaced of **unpaid contractors and cost overruns** at the Taj Mahal, and bankers expressed doubts about Trump’s ability to service his $*“debt mountain”* ([How the Atlantic City Disaster Set Trump up to Pay No Taxes for Years - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-atlantic-city-disaster-casinos-hotels-trump-pay-no-taxes-2020-10#:~:text=But%20all%20was%20not%20well,down%20on%20Trump%27s%20seaside%20empire)). New Jersey’s casino regulators concluded that **“the possibility of a complete financial collapse of the Trump Organization was not out of the question,”** given the precarious finances of his Atlantic City operations ([How the Atlantic City Disaster Set Trump up to Pay No Taxes for Years - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-atlantic-city-disaster-casinos-hotels-trump-pay-no-taxes-2020-10#:~:text=mountain%20used%20to%20finance%20the,down%20on%20Trump%27s%20seaside%20empire)). This was an extraordinary statement – essentially a warning that Trump’s casinos were on a knife’s edge. (Indeed, shortly before the Taj’s 1990 opening, Trump had to go to extreme lengths to stave off default, including a controversial transaction in which his father Fred Trump purchased $3.5 million in casino chips to infuse cash – an act later penalized by regulators as an illegal loan, though that occurred just after our period, in early 1990.)

- **Contractor and Business Lawsuits:** Trump’s companies became famously litigious during this era, both as plaintiffs and defendants. Numerous **contractors, vendors, and even lawyers sued Trump entities over unpaid bills** in the late ’80s. For instance, contractors who built the Taj Mahal later testified that **hundreds of subcontractors were not paid in full or on time** for their work ([What's up with all these allegations from former contractors saying ...](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/4oy1mh/whats_up_with_all_these_allegations_from_former/#:~:text=What%27s%20up%20with%20all%20these,or%20on%20time%2C%20including)). (In one case, a tile supplier was owed $1.2 million for materials at the Taj – debts Trump forced into settlement at pennies on the dollar after the casino went bankrupt.) In New York, Trump faced lawsuits over their business practices as well. A notable long-running case involved undocumented Polish laborers who had been hired to demolish the old Bonwit Teller building for Trump Tower in the early ’80s – they sued for back wages and unsafe working conditions. By 1989, a federal judge had found that Trump’s contractors **knowingly employed illegal workers and paid them substandard wages**, and the case was heading toward a costly judgment ([Donald Trump Paid $1.4 Million Over Undocumented Workers - Time](https://time.com/5039109/donald-trump-undocumented-polish-trump-tower-bonwit-teller/#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%20quietly%20paid%20%241,over%20underpaying%20undocumented%20Polish%20laborers)). (Trump eventually settled that labor case in 1998 for $1.4 million ([Donald Trump Paid $1.4 Million Over Undocumented Workers - Time](https://time.com/5039109/donald-trump-undocumented-polish-trump-tower-bonwit-teller/#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%20Paid%20%241,over%20underpaying%20undocumented%20Polish%20laborers)).) While Trump often tried to keep such disputes out of the spotlight – settling cases confidentially or dragging them out – investigative reporters and court records from 1986–89 document a pattern of **Trump companies stiffing the “little guy”**, forcing many small businesses to fight for payment in court ([What's up with all these allegations from former contractors saying ...](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/4oy1mh/whats_up_with_all_these_allegations_from_former/#:~:text=What%27s%20up%20with%20all%20these,or%20on%20time%2C%20including)).

- **Regulatory Fines and Actions:** Despite many investigations, Trump mostly avoided serious *official* sanctions in 1986–89. There were, however, warning signs. In 1988, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) looked into Trump’s rapid accumulation of stock in certain companies (like his surprise purchase of ~4.9% of Hilton Hotels and, separately, shares of Federated Department Stores) to see if he was engaging in market manipulation or insider trading. No enforcement action was announced then, but Trump’s **“greenmail” tactics** – buying stock, hinting at a takeover, then selling at a profit when the price rose – earned him a reputation on Wall Street and likely put him on the SEC’s radar. State regulators in New York City also tussled with Trump: he battled Mayor Ed Koch over tax abatements for his West Side project and was **denied certain tax breaks** after Koch criticized Trump’s overbearing approach ([Business career of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_career_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=Christopher%20Reeve%20%2C%20and%20others%2C,44)). In New Jersey, aside from the later fine related to the Taj chip purchase scheme, regulators mainly pressured Trump to improve his finances. For example, they required him to **inject more equity** into the Taj Mahal before opening (Trump raised funds by issuing $675 million in junk bonds). They also mandated detailed financial reporting and in 1989 briefly considered delaying the Taj license until Trump’s liquidity improved ([How the Atlantic City Disaster Set Trump up to Pay No Taxes for Years - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-atlantic-city-disaster-casinos-hotels-trump-pay-no-taxes-2020-10#:~:text=But%20all%20was%20not%20well,down%20on%20Trump%27s%20seaside%20empire)). Overall, through 1989 Trump managed to keep regulators at bay by negotiating, delaying, or leveraging his celebrity – but the intense scrutiny foreshadowed the crackdown that would come once his finances faltered in 1990.

## Unusual Transactions & Financial Red Flags

A number of Trump’s transactions and financial practices in the late 1980s raised **red flags** for observers, suggesting risk-taking that veered into unsound or possibly unethical territory:

- **Sky-High Leverage and Debt:** Perhaps the biggest red flag was Trump’s heavy reliance on **borrowed money**. Virtually every major purchase he made was financed with extraordinary levels of debt. For example, the **Trump Taj Mahal was financed by $675 million in junk bonds at a steep 14% interest rate** ([Business career of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_career_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=International%20.,instead%20build%20Riverside%20South%2C%20devoid)) – an unusually expensive form of financing. This meant the Taj needed to earn over $95 million *each year* just to pay its bond interest, an enormous hurdle for a single casino. Similarly, Trump’s $407.5 million Plaza Hotel buy was funded by a $425 million loan (meaning Trump put in little to no cash equity of his own) ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=He%20funded%20the%20purchase%20and,guaranteed%20%24125%20million%20of%20it)). He even borrowed to buy his airline business. By the end of 1989, Trump’s empire was **over $3.4 billion in debt**, owing money to more than 70 banks, and **Trump had personally guaranteed about $800 million** of that debt ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial ...](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=Art%20of%20the%20spin%3A%20Trump,by%20his%20own%20assets%2C)). Such personal guarantees – where Trump’s own assets were on the line if loans went bad – were highly unusual for a man of his supposed wealth and signaled how overextended he was. One banking analyst later noted that **no other developer of Trump’s stature had ever personally guaranteed so much**; it was a sign that banks were lending based more on Trump’s celebrity than on solid fundamentals, and it put Trump’s personal fortune at severe risk ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial ...](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=Art%20of%20the%20spin%3A%20Trump,by%20his%20own%20assets%2C)). These high-debt deals were sustainable only as long as the economy and property values kept rising, which would soon change.

- **Cash Flow Problems and Creative Accounting:** Trump’s deals often **barely generated enough income to cover their financing costs**, if at all. The Plaza Hotel, for instance, was losing money from day one under its huge mortgage – as one biography noted, filling *all 814 rooms every night at $500* each (far above actual rates) would have been necessary just to service the Plaza’s debt ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDonald%E2%80%99s%20purchase%20of%20the%20Plaza,biography%20of%20Trump%2C%20Lost%20Tycoon)). Trump’s casinos likewise struggled to turn profits given their debt loads and high overhead. To cope, Trump’s organization became creative in shuffling money among entities. There is evidence that Trump **moved funds between his businesses or sought last-minute bailouts to paper over shortfalls**. A notorious example (just after this period, in 1990) was Fred Trump’s purchase of casino chips as an emergency infusion to Trump Castle – an apparent attempt to help Donald make a bond payment ([How the Atlantic City Disaster Set Trump up to Pay No Taxes for Years - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-atlantic-city-disaster-casinos-hotels-trump-pay-no-taxes-2020-10#:~:text=But%20all%20was%20not%20well,down%20on%20Trump%27s%20seaside%20empire)). While that specific act fell outside 1986–89, the underlying issue – Trump’s companies running out of cash – was already present in 1989. Vendors at Trump projects complained of slow or partial payments, suggesting Trump was stretching payables to conserve cash ([How the Atlantic City Disaster Set Trump up to Pay No Taxes for Years - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-atlantic-city-disaster-casinos-hotels-trump-pay-no-taxes-2020-10#:~:text=But%20all%20was%20not%20well,down%20on%20Trump%27s%20seaside%20empire)). Such behavior can be a warning sign of deeper financial strain or even potential fraud (if obligations are hidden or delayed deliberately). Indeed, Trump’s later tax records would reveal he was **claiming huge business losses** during this period, even as he boasted of success. According to investigative reporting by *The New York Times*, Trump **reported over $915 million in losses in 1990–91**, allowing him to avoid income taxes for years ([How the Atlantic City Disaster Set Trump up to Pay No Taxes for Years - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-atlantic-city-disaster-casinos-hotels-trump-pay-no-taxes-2020-10#:~:text=,of%20shares%20in%20the%20new)). A portion of those losses stemmed from the collapse of his 1980s ventures, indicating that **the seeds of those tax write-offs were transactions from 1986–89 that went sour**.

- **Greenmail and Stock Manipulation Tactics:** Trump at times engaged in *unusual stock transactions* that drew scrutiny. In 1986–88, he repeatedly bought stakes in publicly traded companies, then exited those positions in ways that made observers question his intent. For instance, in early 1988 Trump quietly accumulated stock in **Federated Department Stores** and **MCA (Music Corporation of America)**, and publicly mused about getting into those businesses ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=In%20the%20first%20three%20months,Beach%2C%20Florida%2C%20to%20lower%20the)). The shares spiked on takeover speculation. Trump then sold his positions at a profit, effectively **profiting from rumors he himself stoked**. A few years earlier, in 1986, he did something similar with **Holiday Corporation** (parent of Holiday Inn), hinting at a takeover to push up the price and then backtracking. This behavior – often termed **“greenmail”** – was when a corporate raider buys up stock and threatens a takeover to extort a buyout of his shares at a premium. While Trump’s maneuvers were not as blatant as some raiders (e.g. he didn’t always get paid greenmail directly), *the pattern was suspicious*. In the Resorts International case, Trump was essentially accused of talking down the company’s prospects (which he publicly did, calling Resorts poorly managed) to scare shareholders into selling, then hoping to profit by taking it private cheaply ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=struggling%20city,impulsive%20than%20that%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said)). An independent banker who reviewed the case noted that attributing such a calculated scheme to Trump might give him too much credit – *“I think Trump is more impulsive than that,”* he testified, suggesting Trump’s moves were opportunistic if not premeditated ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=Trump%20had%20disparaged%20the%20company,impulsive%20than%20that%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said)). Nonetheless, Trump’s reputation on Wall Street became that of a **speculator** willing to play games with public companies. The SEC never charged him in the ’80s, but this reputation made it harder for him to raise money in the stock market later (when he took his casino company public in the 1990s, investors remembered the 1980s incidents).

- **Money Laundering Red Flags:** Trump’s real estate, especially high-end condos, attracted wealthy foreign buyers – including figures later identified as criminals parking illicit funds in U.S. assets. A striking example came to light in 1988: **David Bogatin**, a Soviet-born organized crime figure, had purchased five luxury condos in Trump Tower in 1984 for $6 million in cash ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=A%20monument%20to%20celebrity%20and,to%20Wayne%20Barrett%2C%20who%2016)) ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=If%20the%20transaction%20seemed%20suspicious%E2%80%94multiple,%E2%80%9CIt%20didn%E2%80%99t%20matter)). In 1987, Bogatin pleaded guilty to a massive gasoline-tax evasion scheme linked to the Russian mob, and he fled the country. The U.S. government **seized his five Trump Tower condos**, calling them laundered assets – prosecutors said Bogatin bought those apartments **“to launder money, to shelter and hide assets.”** ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=In%201987%2C%20just%20three%20years,Semion%20Mogilevich%2C%20whom%20the%20FBI)). A Senate investigation later confirmed Bogatin was a key figure in the Russian mafia in New York ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=bootlegging%20scheme%20with%20Russian%20mobsters,fellow%20gangsters%20as%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20most)). Notably, **Trump himself had personally attended the closing when Bogatin bought the condos** ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=building%20was%20a%20hit%E2%80%94all%20but,the%20closing%2C%20along%20with%20Bogatin)), suggesting Trump knew when someone bought an unusual number of units. While there’s no evidence Trump abetted the money laundering, the incident highlighted how **Trump properties became a magnet for dirty money**. According to experts, throughout the ’80s and ’90s, **criminals often used condos in projects like Trump’s to wash cash**, taking advantage of anonymity and lack of scrutiny in luxury real estate ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=If%20the%20transaction%20seemed%20suspicious%E2%80%94multiple,rise%2C%20and%20it%20was%20a)). Trump Tower was one of the first NYC buildings to sell units to shell companies (anonymous buyers) ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=launder%20money%2C%E2%80%9D%20says%20Jonathan%20Winer%2C,York%20that%20accepted%20anonymous%20buyers)). This lax approach meant that while Trump made sales, some of those transactions were *“unusual”* in that the buyers’ funds came from suspicious sources. Such patterns raised red flags for law enforcement; by the end of the 1980s the FBI and other agencies were looking more closely at money flows in casinos and real estate for signs of **money laundering**. (Indeed, later on, Trump’s Taj Mahal casino would be fined repeatedly in the 1990s and 2000s for money-laundering compliance failures, suggesting oversight was weak ([Trump's Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=Trump%27s%20Russian%20Laundromat%20,%E2%80%9Claunder%20money%2C%20to%20shelter)). In one case, the Taj was penalized in 1998 for having inadequate anti-money-laundering controls as early as its opening year, 1990.)

- **Tax Avoidance Schemes:** Though not fully known to the public at the time, Trump’s 1980s deals set the stage for aggressive **tax avoidance**. Real estate developers often used paper losses, depreciation, and debt write-downs to erase taxable income. Trump took this to the extreme. When his empire faltered by 1990, he negotiated debt forgiveness from banks and huge write-offs. Using a provision of the tax code, he later **claimed a nearly $73 million tax refund** on prior taxes, by carrying back losses from his casino bankruptcies ([How the Atlantic City Disaster Set Trump up to Pay No Taxes for Years - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-atlantic-city-disaster-casinos-hotels-trump-pay-no-taxes-2020-10#:~:text=,the%20company%20they%27re%20leaving%20behind)). Essentially, the colossal losses from the Taj Mahal and other ventures became a tax *asset* for Trump personally. While this maneuver occurred after 1989 (in the early 1990s and later), it was enabled by the **financial collapse of his 1986–89 expansion spree**. Even during the late ’80s, there were hints of aggressive tax strategy: Trump’s businesses took large depreciation deductions and wrote down impaired assets. For example, Trump purchased the Plaza Hotel personally (not through a public company), which allowed him to possibly **write off its operating losses against his other income**. The public got a glimpse of Trump’s tax avoidance mentality when his 1987 bestseller *The Art of the Deal* bragged that he **paid little in taxes** thanks to depreciation: *“I love depreciation. It’s like a gift from heaven,”* he wrote, noting that it shielded a lot of income ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=Trump%20must%20have%20known%20because,the%20Plaza%2C%E2%80%9D%20read%20the%20title)) ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20haven%E2%80%99t%20purchased%20a%20building%2C,hotel%20which%20transcends%20all%20others%21%E2%80%9D)). While legal, these tactics become red flags when losses are artificially inflated or when debt is forgiven (which normally counts as income, unless artfully avoided). The bottom line is that Trump’s complex web of transactions in 1986–89 – high debt, intercompany loans, asset swaps, etc. – created opportunities to **mask the true financial state** of his empire and to minimize taxes, albeit at the cost of pushing his companies closer to insolvency.

## Insider Testimonies & Public Statements

A stark **gap between Trump’s public claims and the behind-the-scenes reality** was evident by the end of the 1980s. Comparing Trump’s own statements with financial records and insider accounts reveals numerous contradictions:

- **Boasts vs. Reality – The “Art of the Deal” Era:** Trump cultivated an image as a master deal-maker. In his 1987 autobiography *The Art of the Deal*, and in countless interviews, he touted his business acumen – claiming he *“never overpay(s)”* and *“always”* makes smart deals. Yet in practice, by 1988 he was doing deals purely for glory. Even **Trump admitted in 1988 that the Plaza Hotel deal made no financial sense**, writing in a public letter-ad entitled *“Why I Bought the Plaza”* that *“for the first time in my life, I have knowingly made a deal which was not economic”* ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=Trump%20must%20have%20known%20because,the%20Plaza%2C%E2%80%9D%20read%20the%20title)). He portrayed the purchase as a gift to New York – *“I haven’t purchased a building, I have purchased a masterpiece… I can never justify the price no matter how successful the Plaza becomes”* ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=Trump%20must%20have%20known%20because,the%20Plaza%2C%E2%80%9D%20read%20the%20title)). This candid admission (aimed at deflecting criticism that he overpaid) stood in contrast to Trump’s usual **hyperbole about his success**. In the same letter, Trump promised to renovate the Plaza into the world’s premier hotel, and indeed he put his wife Ivana in charge of a lavish refurbishment ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20haven%E2%80%99t%20purchased%20a%20building%2C,hotel%20which%20transcends%20all%20others%21%E2%80%9D)). But **financial records later showed the Plaza lost money every year of Trump’s ownership**, unable to carry the debt load. By 1992 Trump had to give up majority control of the Plaza to resolve its bankruptcy – a humbling outcome for a deal he had trumpeted publicly ([Donald Trump bluffed his way out of bankruptcy in the 90s — will ...](https://nypost.com/2024/01/11/news/how-donald-trump-bluffed-his-way-out-of-bankruptcy-in-the-90s/#:~:text=,to%20finance%20the%20purchase)).

- **“Atlantic City fueled a lot of growth” – or a house of cards?** Trump consistently painted his Atlantic City casinos as a great success, even as insiders knew they were in trouble. For example, Trump claimed in retrospect that **“Atlantic City fueled a lot of growth for me. The money I took out of there was incredible.”** ([How the Atlantic City Disaster Set Trump up to Pay No Taxes for Years - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-atlantic-city-disaster-casinos-hotels-trump-pay-no-taxes-2020-10#:~:text=The%20casinos%20were%20turning%20out,out%20of%20there%20was%20incredible)) This statement to the *New York Times* glossed over how those casinos were actually performing. In truth, by 1989 the casinos were barely solvent. Internal casino regulatory reports and casino executives were raising alarms about the Taj Mahal’s viability even before it opened. **Marvin Roffman, a veteran gaming industry analyst, told Trump to his face in 1988 that the Taj Mahal would fail financially** – *“I think you made a mistake,”* Roffman said when Trump phoned looking for praise on the deal ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=%E2%80%9CHe%20called%20me%20on%20the,%E2%80%99%E2%80%9D)). Trump was reportedly furious and tried to get Roffman fired for his negative outlook. (Roffman was indeed ousted after publicly predicting the Taj would go bankrupt – a prediction proven correct in 1991. He later said, “I was fired for telling the truth.”) Likewise, Trump’s own **vice president in charge of construction, Barbara Res**, grew concerned as Trump kept spending and expanding. She observed that Trump’s appetite was endless – *“He was just buying up things with loans, and that’s what caught up with him… There was never enough for him. Nothing satisfied him.”* ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=%E2%80%9CHe%20was%20just%20buying%20up,%E2%80%9D)). This candid testimony from an insider contrasts with Trump’s public bravado that everything he touched turned to gold. In reality, **by 1989 Trump’s core businesses were straining**: his top casino executives resigned or died (three Trump Casino executives were killed in a 1989 helicopter crash, an event that left the Atlantic City operations in disarray), contractors were unpaid, and Trump had to inject outside cash (and secretly rely on his father’s help) to keep the casinos running ([How the Atlantic City Disaster Set Trump up to Pay No Taxes for Years - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-atlantic-city-disaster-casinos-hotels-trump-pay-no-taxes-2020-10#:~:text=But%20all%20was%20not%20well,down%20on%20Trump%27s%20seaside%20empire)). None of this was admitted publicly at the time – Trump continued to project confidence.

- **Inflated Wealth Claims:** Throughout the 1980s, Trump was obsessed with being seen as extremely wealthy – and he often **inflated his net worth in public statements**. Forbes magazine’s “400 Richest Americans” list regularly included Trump based on information he provided. (It was later revealed that in 1984 Trump had exaggerated his assets to Forbes by pretending to be an aide named “John Barron” – a *deception that inflated his estimated net worth* by hundreds of millions.) By 1987, Forbes estimated Trump’s worth at $1 billion, and in 1989 at $1.7 billion. Trump did nothing to dispel those lofty numbers; on the contrary, he encouraged the idea that he was a billionaire. However, **bank documents and internal financial statements told another story**. When Trump’s empire nearly crashed in 1990, **analysts discovered his true debt far outweighed his assets**, to the point that his **net worth was arguably negative** by 1990 (had he been forced to liquidate, his debts were greater than the market value of his properties) ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial ...](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=Art%20of%20the%20spin%3A%20Trump,by%20his%20own%20assets%2C)). The **Time magazine** interview in January 1989 captured Trump’s evasiveness on this issue. Confronted with pinning down a number for his wealth, he joked that it depends on Japanese buyers (using a derogatory term) ([Former Tampa Mayor Sandy Freedman recalls Donald Trump's eye-opening 1988 visit](https://www.tampabay.com/sandy-freedman-recalls-an-eye-opening-visit-to-tampa-by-donald-trump-in/2281171/#:~:text=The%20term%20did%2C%20however%2C%20appear,about%20his%20wealth%20and%20worth)). This quip – *“Who the f--- knows? … Who knows how much the Japs will pay for Manhattan property these days?”* – revealed that Trump’s own sense of value was tied to the bubble of the late ’80s real estate market. By implying that some absurd price from a foreign buyer could materialize, he avoided admitting that much of his “wealth” was paper equity in over-leveraged buildings. In private, according to biographer Harry Hurt III, **Trump’s accountants knew he was heading toward a cash crunch** ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDonald%E2%80%99s%20purchase%20of%20the%20Plaza,biography%20of%20Trump%2C%20Lost%20Tycoon)), even as Trump was bragging in the press about new deals. This gap between *public persona and private reality* would only widen when banks finally forced Trump to confront his finances in 1990.

- **Support from Family and Banks (Quiet Bailouts):** Insiders later revealed that **Trump survived 1989 only with emergency help** that he never advertised. In early 1990, as his loan payments came due, **Trump’s father Fred Trump stepped in with a $3 million cash infusion (disguised as chip purchases at the Castle Casino) and Trump’s siblings also lent him money** to meet obligations ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=the%20shuttle%2C%20the%20Plaza%20Hotel,beholden%20to%20the%20banks%E2%80%94the%20banks)). Trump’s public stance, however, was that he was a self-made man who never needed financial help from his family. Likewise, Trump’s relationships with banks were strained by 1989, but publicly he maintained that banks were eager to do business with him. In truth, **bank consortia began to take control of Trump’s budgeting** in 1989–90, imposing restrictions on his spending. One creditor described Trump at that time as **“a man drowning in debt who refused to admit he was sinking”** (quote from a 1991 book). Yet Trump’s public comments gave no hint of panic; he insisted the Atlantic City casinos were “fantastic” and that the Trump Shuttle, though launched at great cost, would be profitable soon (it never was – it was turned over to creditors in 1991). This disparity was noted by people like New Jersey Casino Commission chair Steven Perskie, who later said dealing with Trump was frustrating because of **“his tendency to say whatever he feels like, regardless of facts”**. 

- **Contemporaneous Journalism:** Investigative journalists in the late ’80s began to peel back the facade. **Wayne Barrett’s** book *Trump: The Deals and the Downfall* and **David Cay Johnston’s** casino reporting (both published in the early ’90s) documented that Trump’s actual business practices were far shadier than his public image suggested. For example, Barrett uncovered Trump’s ties to organized crime figures in the construction of Trump Tower (mob-linked union boss John Cody received special favors) and noted that **Trump’s claims of construction costs or profits were often unsubstantiated or false**. In one case, Trump publicly claimed a $100+ million profit on his Commodore/Grand Hyatt hotel deal, but Barrett showed much of that “profit” was derived from tax abatements and accounting tricks, not cash in hand. Similarly, *The Wall Street Journal* in 1990 reported that **Trump’s 1988 tax return listed him as having negative income – despite the apparent success of his businesses**. When confronted with these reports, Trump typically denied any problems and accused the press of bias. However, the **weight of insider testimony, court documents, and regulators’ reports by 1989 painted a clear picture**: Trump’s empire was **built on fragile financial ground**. As one New York real estate rival quipped in 1990, “Donald was a great marketer. He got everyone to believe he was a genius, until the bills came due.” The insider consensus was that Trump’s public statements in 1986–89 often did not match the facts – whether it was **projecting optimism about a deal that was actually under water, or claiming wealth and success while secretly scrambling to stay solvent**.

## Conclusion

Between 1986 and 1989, Donald Trump assembled a glittering portfolio of properties and enjoyed the spotlight as a daring deal-maker, but beneath the surface, his financial dealings showed **mounting vulnerabilities**. He leveraged to the hilt to acquire marquee assets like the Taj Mahal casino and the Plaza Hotel ([Business career of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_career_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=International%20.,of%20a%20park%20and%20shorter)) ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=He%20funded%20the%20purchase%20and,guaranteed%20%24125%20million%20of%20it)), entangling himself with international financiers and investors to fund his ambitions ([Long before bashing China on trade, Trump teed off on Japan - The World from PRX](https://theworld.org/stories/2019/05/24/long-bashing-china-trade-trump-tee-japan#:~:text=But%20there%20have%20been%20contradictions,real%20estate%20to%20Japanese%20buyers)) ([The Hidden History of Trump’s First Trip to Moscow - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/19/trump-first-moscow-trip-215842#:~:text=According%20to%20The%20Art%20of,and%20the%20state%20Hermitage%20museum)). This rapid expansion invited lawsuits, from antitrust courtrooms to contract disputes, and drew increasing scrutiny from regulators who feared his empire could collapse ([How the Atlantic City Disaster Set Trump up to Pay No Taxes for Years - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-atlantic-city-disaster-casinos-hotels-trump-pay-no-taxes-2020-10#:~:text=But%20all%20was%20not%20well,down%20on%20Trump%27s%20seaside%20empire)) ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=struggling%20city,impulsive%20than%20that%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said)). Indeed, many **unusual transactions – junk bond financing, opaque stock plays, questionable payments to vendors, and purchases by dubious characters – signaled serious red flags** ([Business career of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_career_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=International%20.,instead%20build%20Riverside%20South%2C%20devoid)) ([Trump’s Russian Laundromat | The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate#:~:text=In%201987%2C%20just%20three%20years,Semion%20Mogilevich%2C%20whom%20the%20FBI)). Throughout it all, Trump’s public bravado never waned, even as colleagues and records contradicted his rosy pronouncements ([1988: The Year Donald Trump Lost His Mind - POLITICO Magazine](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/1988-the-year-donald-lost-his-mind-213721#:~:text=%E2%80%9CHe%20was%20just%20buying%20up,%E2%80%9D)) ([How the Atlantic City Disaster Set Trump up to Pay No Taxes for Years - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-atlantic-city-disaster-casinos-hotels-trump-pay-no-taxes-2020-10#:~:text=,Jersey%20casino%20regulators%20concluded%20somberly)). In essence, the 1986–1989 period was a **high-wire act** for Trump: he reached new heights of fame and nominal wealth, but largely by courting risk and skirting the edge of financial ruin. The cracks began to show by 1989, and within another year the **house of cards collapsed into a series of debt restructurings and bankruptcies** ([Business career of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_career_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=International%20.,of%20a%20park%20and%20shorter)) ([Business career of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_career_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=The%20Taj%20Mahal%20emerged%20from,ownership%20stake%20and)). The detailed evidence – from court documents and banking records to insider memoirs – reveals that Trump’s late-’80s triumphs were often built on unstable foundations. As one gaming regulator summed up in 1991, **“Good publicity and political spin can’t pay off junk bonds”**, a lesson Donald Trump learned as the exuberance of the 1980s gave way to the realities of the 1990s.
