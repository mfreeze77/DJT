# Donald Trump’s Financial Dealings (2013–2017)

## Real Estate Transactions & Deals

Donald Trump remained active in real estate between 2013 and 2017, engaging in notable property acquisitions, development projects, and sales. Some of the major transactions and deals during this period include: 

- **Trump International Hotel, Washington D.C. (Old Post Office)** – In 2013, the Trump Organization won a 60-year lease from the U.S. General Services Administration to redevelop Washington’s historic Old Post Office building ([Old Post Office (Washington, D.C.) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Post_Office_(Washington,_D.C.)#:~:text=In%202013%2C%20the%20U,C)). Trump invested in converting the federally owned landmark into a luxury hotel, which opened in September 2016 as the Trump International Hotel D.C. The project was financed in part by a $170 million construction loan from Deutsche Bank, reflecting Trump’s continued reliance on that lender ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=Mortgages%20on%20Trump%27s%20major%20properties%C2%A0%E2%80%93,in%20debt%20and%20other%20collateral)) ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=accounting%20firm%20estimated%20%24451,of%20the%20Americas%20for%20almost)). The hotel quickly became a flagship property, though its federal lease later drew scrutiny once Trump took office due to a clause barring elected officials from benefiting ([Old Post Office (Washington, D.C.) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Post_Office_(Washington,_D.C.)#:~:text=match%20at%20L1212%20The%20Trump,Responsibility%20and%20Ethics%20in%20Washington)).

- **Golf Resorts in Scotland & Ireland** – Trump expanded his golf empire overseas. In 2014, he purchased the iconic Turnberry golf resort in Scotland for a reported £35–£40 million (about $60 million) ([Turnberry (golf course) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnberry_(golf_course)#:~:text=match%20at%20L286%20Donald%20Trump,inaugurated%20as%20President%20of%20the)). He rebranded it Trump Turnberry and claimed to have invested around $200 million in renovations (though U.K. filings showed about $18 million spent by 2016) ([Turnberry (golf course) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnberry_(golf_course)#:~:text=match%20at%20L291%2019%20,21)). That same year, he acquired Doonbeg Golf Resort in County Clare, Ireland for approximately €15 million ([Trump International Golf Links and Hotel Ireland - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_International_Golf_Links_and_Hotel_Ireland#:~:text=In%20February%202014%2C%20the%20lodge,for%20Finance%2C%20Michael%20Noonan%2C%20was)). Both resorts were acquired at steep discounts during economic downturns, and Trump later downplayed their importance, calling the Irish resort “small potatoes” as he pivoted to politics ([Trump International Golf Links and Hotel Ireland - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_International_Golf_Links_and_Hotel_Ireland#:~:text=match%20at%20L171%20he%20bought,7)).

- **Domestic Properties and Developments** – Trump’s business also pursued domestic projects. His company continued to sell condominium units and lease office space in its core holdings like Trump Tower (NYC) and 40 Wall Street, and managed properties across the U.S. In 2014, the Trump Organization opened Trump National Doral’s renovated golf course (acquired in 2012) and initiated development of Trump-branded hotels in various cities. Notably, Trump **sold his interest in non-core ventures** during this time: for example, in 2015 he sold the Miss Universe Organization (which included Miss USA and Miss Teen USA pageants) to WME/IMG for an undisclosed sum ([Donald Trump Sells the Miss Universe Organization - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-sells-miss-universe-img-2015-9#:~:text=According%20to%20Trump%27s%20financial%20disclosure,5%20million%20and%20%2425%20million)) ([Donald Trump Sells the Miss Universe Organization - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-sells-miss-universe-img-2015-9#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%20has%20just%20sold,groups%2C%20to%20the%20agency%20WME%2FIMG)) after a public fallout with broadcast partners. This sale came just days after he had bought out NBCUniversal’s 50% stake, ending Trump’s long involvement in the pageant business amid his presidential campaign.

- **Licensing & Branded Projects** – Instead of directly investing in many new buildings, Trump often licensed his name to projects developed by others. Between 2013 and 2017, Trump-branded luxury towers rose in places like **Toronto, Vancouver, Manila, Mumbai, and Pune**, generating licensing fees without Trump owning the underlying properties. For instance, Trump Tower Pune and Trump Tower Mumbai were developed by Indian partners who paid for the use of the Trump name. In 2016, Trump’s partner opened the 69-story Trump Tower in Manila, Philippines under a licensing deal. These deals allowed Trump to collect fees and a share of sales ([Donald Trump wealth details released by federal regulators – Deseret News](https://www.deseret.com/2015/7/22/20484466/donald-trump-wealth-details-released-by-federal-regulators/#:~:text=reflect%20his%20wealth,from%20a%20developer%20in%20Panama)). One example: his 2015 financial disclosure showed a **$5 million payment from a Panama developer** – reflecting Trump’s management and branding contract for the Trump Ocean Club in Panama ([Donald Trump wealth details released by federal regulators – Deseret News](https://www.deseret.com/2015/7/22/20484466/donald-trump-wealth-details-released-by-federal-regulators/#:~:text=reflect%20his%20wealth,from%20a%20developer%20in%20Panama)). While providing revenue, some foreign branding deals later faced problems (the Trump-branded Panama City hotel had a legal dispute with its owners and removed Trump’s name in 2018, and planned projects in Brazil, Azerbaijan, and Georgia were ultimately shelved by 2017). 

Overall, Trump’s real estate dealings in this period show a mix of **high-profile acquisitions** (especially golf resorts and the D.C. hotel) and an emphasis on **low-investment licensing ventures** abroad. These strategies let him expand his brand’s global footprint even as he avoided the financial risk of large new constructions. However, the properties he did buy often required significant capital and drew financing and partners that would intertwine with his later political role.

## Debt & Liquidity

Trump entered this period with a self-described moniker “King of Debt,” and his financial filings underscore that heavy leverage was a feature of his business. **By the mid-2010s, Trump’s companies carried hundreds of millions of dollars in debt, which he managed through refinancing and complex arrangements** ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=accounting%20firm%20estimated%20%24451,of%20the%20Americas%20for%20almost)) ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=Fortune%20magazine.,2020%2C%20it%20was%20reported%20that)). Key aspects of Trump’s debt and liquidity situation from 2013–2017 include:

- **Major Loans and Mortgages:** Trump’s prime real estate assets were highly leveraged. Federal disclosures in 2015 showed he owed at least **$265 million in debt** in total ([Donald Trump wealth details released by federal regulators – Deseret News](https://www.deseret.com/2015/7/22/20484466/donald-trump-wealth-details-released-by-federal-regulators/#:~:text=The%20report%20shows%20his%20assets,of%20at%20least%20%24265%20million)), and later analyses put his debt load even higher – at **$604–650 million by 2016** ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=accounting%20firm%20estimated%20%24451,of%20the%20Americas%20for%20almost)). For example, Trump Tower in Manhattan had a $100 million mortgage (taken in 2012), 40 Wall Street had about $160 million, and his Trump Doral golf resort about $125 million – all categorized in the highest debt range (“over $50 million”) on his disclosure ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=Mortgages%20on%20Trump%27s%20major%20properties%C2%A0%E2%80%93,in%20debt%20and%20other%20collateral)). These loans carried interest rates between roughly 4% and 7%, and many were interest-only mortgages maturing in the 2020s ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=Mortgages%20on%20Trump%27s%20major%20properties%C2%A0%E2%80%93,in%20debt%20and%20other%20collateral)). Trump’s biggest lender during this time was **Deutsche Bank**, which extended large loans despite Trump’s past defaults. In 2014, Deutsche Bank’s private wealth unit lent Trump around **$170 million** to finance the D.C. hotel project ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=accounting%20firm%20estimated%20%24451,of%20the%20Americas%20for%20almost)). Other lenders like Ladder Capital also issued mortgages against Trump properties, indicating a significant reliance on debt to fund or extract cash from his holdings.

- **Refinancing and Internal Debt Maneuvers:** Trump often refinanced properties to manage liquidity. One unusual debt item appeared on his financial disclosures: a **loan exceeding $50 million owed to an entity called Chicago Unit Acquisition LLC**, which is a Trump-owned company ([The Mysterious Loan Trump Made to Himself and More | Trump, Inc. | WNYC Studios](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/trumpinc/episodes/trump-inc-podcast-mysterious-loan-trump-made-himself-more#:~:text=%E2%80%94%20from%20something%20called%20Chicago,Unit%20Acquisition%2C%20LLC)). In essence, Trump was claiming his business owed a huge sum to *himself* (or his own affiliate). This opaque **“Chicago Unit Acquisition” loan**, tied to his Trump Tower in Chicago, raised eyebrows because there is no evidence such a loan from an outside creditor exists ([$50 Million “Mystery Loan” to Trump Warrants Inquiry, Watchdog ...](https://truthout.org/articles/50-million-mystery-loan-to-trump-warrants-inquiry-watchdog-group-says/#:~:text=%2450%20Million%20%E2%80%9CMystery%20Loan%E2%80%9D%20to,no%20evidence%20it%20ever%20existed)) ([FBI, DOJ Urged to Investigate Trump Over Chicago Business Debt](https://www.taxnotes.com/lr/resolve/tax-notes-today-federal/fbi-doj-urged-to-investigate-trump-over-chicago-business-debt/7jflc#:~:text=Debt%20www,LLC%20for%20the%20Chicago)). Analysts have suggested this could have been an accounting move – perhaps related to forgiven debt from the Chicago project’s past financing – allowing Trump to carry a phantom liability (potentially for tax advantages) ([$50 Million “Mystery Loan” to Trump Warrants Inquiry, Watchdog ...](https://truthout.org/articles/50-million-mystery-loan-to-trump-warrants-inquiry-watchdog-group-says/#:~:text=%2450%20Million%20%E2%80%9CMystery%20Loan%E2%80%9D%20to,no%20evidence%20it%20ever%20existed)) ([Trump’s $50 Million Mystery Debt Looks Like ‘Tax Evasion’](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-dollar50-million-mystery-debt-looks-like-tax-evasion/#:~:text=KING%20OF%20DEBT)). In later court proceedings, Trump representatives even indicated this debt might never have been an arm’s-length loan at all, calling into question its legitimacy ([Trump’s $50 Million Mystery Debt Looks Like ‘Tax Evasion’](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-dollar50-million-mystery-debt-looks-like-tax-evasion/#:~:text=KING%20OF%20DEBT)). The maneuver illustrates how Trump’s debt picture was at times **opaque**, with inter-company transactions clouding the true extent of what he owed to outside lenders.

- **Cashflow & Liquidity:** Despite significant asset values, Trump’s available liquid cash was relatively limited compared to his wealth claims. He famously stated during the campaign that he could self-fund with $600 million if needed, but in reality his 2015 disclosure showed **about $70 million in stocks** and a cash position likely under a few hundred million ([Donald Trump wealth details released by federal regulators – Deseret News](https://www.deseret.com/2015/7/22/20484466/donald-trump-wealth-details-released-by-federal-regulators/#:~:text=donors.)) ([Donald Trump wealth details released by federal regulators – Deseret News](https://www.deseret.com/2015/7/22/20484466/donald-trump-wealth-details-released-by-federal-regulators/#:~:text=The%20report%20shows%20his%20assets,of%20at%20least%20%24265%20million)). In early 2016, Trump actually sold off a large portion of his stock portfolio to raise cash ([The Trump Organization - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization#:~:text=,forward%20with%20new%20domestic%20agreements)), which he then used to help fund his presidential run. By mid-2016 he had put **over $43 million of his own money** (via loans to his campaign) into the race ([Donald Trump's big money bait-and-switch – Center for Public Integrity](https://publicintegrity.org/politics/donald-trumps-big-money-bait-and-switch/#:~:text=Trump%20is%20not%20exclusively%20self,his%20campaign)) ([Donald Trump's big money bait-and-switch – Center for Public Integrity](https://publicintegrity.org/politics/donald-trumps-big-money-bait-and-switch/#:~:text=Make%20no%20mistake%3A%20He%20has,of%20federal%20campaign%20finance%20disclosures)), indicating significant liquidity was deployed for politics. Even so, reports suggest Trump’s **liquid assets were constrained**; for instance, an analysis of his records by the New York Attorney General much later noted he had under $100 million in cash by 2020 ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=In%20January%202022%2C%20a%20filing,180%20%5D%20and%20ultimately)) ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=reported%20that%20Trump%27s%20tax%20documents,he%20would%20cancel%20Trump%27s%20business)). During 2013–2017, Trump often managed cash by **borrowing against properties or selling assets** (rather than large cash reserves) – a strategy that kept him solvent but also perpetually in debt. 

- **Debt Profile and Risk:** By the time he took office, Trump personally guaranteed many of his loans, meaning his **personal finances were intertwined with business debts**. The *New York Times* investigation later revealed Trump was personally responsible for **$421 million in loans coming due in the next few years** (as of 2020) ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=%24500%C2%A0million%20of%20income%20in%20mid,142)), much of it stemming from the 2012–2015 financings. In 2016, one analysis found that counting a share of debt on a property he co-owned (1290 Avenue of the Americas in NYC), Trump’s **total debt might top $650 million** ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=accounting%20firm%20estimated%20%24451,of%20the%20Americas%20for%20almost)) ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=Fortune%20magazine.,2020%2C%20it%20was%20reported%20that)). Notably, that Manhattan skyscraper’s loan included **$211 million from the state-owned Bank of China** due in 2022 ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=2016.,139)), underscoring that Trump’s business debts connected him to various financial actors, including foreign banks. This heavy debt load left questions about Trump’s **ability to service obligations if his businesses faltered**, and became a point of concern when he became President (since creditors’ leverage over a sitting president could pose conflicts).

In sum, from 2013 to 2017 Trump’s operations were **highly leveraged**, with major properties mortgaged and constant refinancing. While this leverage allowed him to acquire and sustain a vast business empire despite limited personal liquidity, it also meant **financial vulnerability**. Trump’s own approach was to tout his use of debt as savvy business – he once said, “I’m the king of debt. I love debt.” – but the complexity and opacity of his borrowing (exemplified by the mysterious Chicago loan) invited scrutiny into how his financial obligations might influence his decisions and stability.

 ([File:Trump Tower (7181836700).jpg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Trump_Tower_(7181836700).jpg)) *Trump Tower in Manhattan, Trump’s flagship property, was refinanced with a $100 million loan in 2012. By 2016, Trump’s real estate empire had at least **$500–650 million** in debt obligations ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=accounting%20firm%20estimated%20%24451,of%20the%20Americas%20for%20almost)) ([Donald Trump wealth details released by federal regulators – Deseret News](https://www.deseret.com/2015/7/22/20484466/donald-trump-wealth-details-released-by-federal-regulators/#:~:text=The%20report%20shows%20his%20assets,of%20at%20least%20%24265%20million)), with Trump Tower, 40 Wall Street, and Doral Golf Resort each carrying mortgages over $50 million ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=Mortgages%20on%20Trump%27s%20major%20properties%C2%A0%E2%80%93,in%20debt%20and%20other%20collateral)).*  

## Revenue Sources

Trump’s income streams in 2013–2017 were diverse, reflecting his myriad business ventures. Public disclosures and investigative reports indicate that Trump **derived revenue from real estate operations, licensing deals, entertainment, and other business activities**. The key sources of revenue during this period included:

- **Real Estate Operating Income:** Trump’s core assets – office buildings, commercial rentals, and condo sales – generated substantial revenue (though net profits are harder to discern). Properties like Trump Tower (through apartment sales and commercial rents), 40 Wall Street (office rents), and Trump hotels and resorts (room bookings, event hosting, golf fees) contributed millions. For example, the Trump Organization’s financial disclosure in 2015 reported over **$250 million in income since January 2014** from Trump’s various businesses ([Donald Trump wealth details released by federal regulators – Deseret News](https://www.deseret.com/2015/7/22/20484466/donald-trump-wealth-details-released-by-federal-regulators/#:~:text=While%20the%20documents%20don%27t%20prove,I%27m%20not%20using%20donors)) ([Donald Trump wealth details released by federal regulators – Deseret News](https://www.deseret.com/2015/7/22/20484466/donald-trump-wealth-details-released-by-federal-regulators/#:~:text=conservative%20reading%20of%20his%20income,I%27m%20not%20using%20donors)). Many of these revenues came from real estate holdings. However, it’s important to note that Trump’s FEC disclosure reports often **listed gross revenue, not profit** – independent analyses showed some ventures were actually losing money even as they reported high revenue. A Bloomberg review found Trump had been reporting only top-line **sales for his golf courses** (e.g. in Scotland and Ireland) on disclosures, whereas UK filings revealed those particular courses operated at a loss ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=132%20,106)). In other words, while Trump might report tens of millions in revenue from a golf resort, the costs often exceeded those earnings ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=132%20,106)).

- **The Apprentice & Television**: A major personal income source for Trump in the early 2010s was his reality TV career. Trump hosted NBC’s *The Apprentice* and *Celebrity Apprentice* until 2015, and these shows proved extremely lucrative for him. Trump **claimed that NBC paid him about $213 million** over 14 seasons of *The Apprentice* ([Donald Trump wealth details released by federal regulators – Deseret News](https://www.deseret.com/2015/7/22/20484466/donald-trump-wealth-details-released-by-federal-regulators/#:~:text=View%20Comments)). (An independent analysis later suggested that when including sponsorships and licensing spinoffs from the show, Trump earned **around $427 million** in total from his reality TV fame over the years ([How Trump's Apprentice earnings helped rescue his failing empire](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/29/trump-tax-returns-the-apprentice-empire#:~:text=How%20Trump%27s%20Apprentice%20earnings%20helped,real%20estate%20and%20casino%20losses)).) His 2015 financial filings didn’t itemize the full TV payout, but did show over $4 million in income in the prior year from his production company tied to the show ([Donald Trump wealth details released by federal regulators – Deseret News](https://www.deseret.com/2015/7/22/20484466/donald-trump-wealth-details-released-by-federal-regulators/#:~:text=View%20Comments)). The Apprentice not only provided cash; it also **bolstered Trump’s brand**, which he leveraged into other deals like endorsements and branded products.

- **Licensing & Merchandise**: Trump monetized his name and image through licensing agreements outside of real estate as well. His 2013–2016 disclosures list numerous licensing deals – for example, **over $1 million in royalties from his menswear line** (Trump-branded suits and ties) ([Donald Trump wealth details released by federal regulators – Deseret News](https://www.deseret.com/2015/7/22/20484466/donald-trump-wealth-details-released-by-federal-regulators/#:~:text=reflect%20his%20wealth,from%20a%20developer%20in%20Panama)), and fees from licensing his name to hotels and towers abroad (such as more than **$1 million from Trump Towers Istanbul** in Turkey ([Donald Trump wealth details released by federal regulators – Deseret News](https://www.deseret.com/2015/7/22/20484466/donald-trump-wealth-details-released-by-federal-regulators/#:~:text=reflect%20his%20wealth,from%20a%20developer%20in%20Panama))). Trump also earned smaller sums from speaking engagements, book royalties (he published titles like *Time to Get Tough* during this period), and product endorsements. An Associated Press review noted Trump even had an Israeli energy drink endorsement ($50k–$100k range) and a Trump-branded coffee venture (though yielding only a few thousand dollars) ([Donald Trump wealth details released by federal regulators – Deseret News](https://www.deseret.com/2015/7/22/20484466/donald-trump-wealth-details-released-by-federal-regulators/#:~:text=licensing%20royalties%20and%20%245%20million,from%20a%20developer%20in%20Panama)). These deals illustrate how **Trump capitalized on his celebrity** status for incremental revenue across many ventures, big and small.

- **Golf & Resort Revenues:** With Trump’s expansion into golf resorts, those properties became a notable part of his income portfolio. Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Palm Beach, generated steady revenue from membership fees and events – and notably increased its initiation fee from $100,000 to $200,000 after Trump’s election, capitalizing on its new status as the “Winter White House.” Trump’s U.S. golf clubs (like Doral in Florida and courses in New Jersey, New York, etc.) brought in revenue from memberships, golf rounds, and hospitality. For instance, Trump National Doral in Miami was listed as producing hefty revenues (over $50 million annually in some disclosures) but struggled with profitability due to high expenses and debt service. Abroad, the Trump Turnberry resort in Scotland and Trump Doonbeg in Ireland had growing sales by 2016, but as mentioned, both ran operating **losses** in those years as they required heavy reinvestment ([Turnberry (golf course) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnberry_(golf_course)#:~:text=Financing%20for%20Trump%27s%20golf%20courses,sources%20and%20%E2%80%93%20or%20at)). Despite mixed profits, these resort properties contributed to Trump’s asset valuation and provided significant cash flow (often reinvested or used to cover their financing costs).

- **Hotel Management & Other Services:** In addition to owning properties, the Trump Organization earned fees by managing hotels and buildings for others. A prominent example was the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Toronto (developed by others), from which Trump took a management and licensing fee until it fell into financial trouble and had his name removed in 2017. Similarly, the Trump hotel in Panama was a licensed project where Trump’s firm earned **management fees and a percentage of condo sales (about $5 million from the Panama developer was recorded in one period) ([Donald Trump wealth details released by federal regulators – Deseret News](https://www.deseret.com/2015/7/22/20484466/donald-trump-wealth-details-released-by-federal-regulators/#:~:text=reflect%20his%20wealth,from%20a%20developer%20in%20Panama))**. Trump’s company also managed a hotel in Baku, Azerbaijan (never opened due to local issues) and pursued management contracts in projects like Trump Baku and Trump Rio (Brazil) – though those did not come to fruition. These management and franchise arrangements were attractive to Trump as they produced **“chunks of cash with virtually no risk,”** comprising an estimated $220 million of his business’s value by early 2017 ([The Trump Organization - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization#:~:text=,forward%20with%20new%20domestic%20agreements)) ([The Trump Organization - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization#:~:text=to%20do%20no%20new%20foreign,forward%20with%20new%20domestic%20agreements)).

According to his federally required financial disclosure, Trump reported **$362 million in gross income for 2014** and **$611 million from January 2015 through mid-2016** ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=Trump%20reported%20a%20yearly%20income,142)). (These figures count revenue streams rather than true profit; much was offset by expenses or losses elsewhere.) Nonetheless, they underscore that Trump’s revenue engine in this period was substantial and multifaceted. It spanned **real estate rents and sales, brand licensing worldwide, club memberships, media payments, and beyond**, befitting a businessman whose name itself had become one of his most valuable commodities. However, as later investigations would show, Trump’s high revenues were often paired with high costs, debts, and write-offs – meaning reported income did not necessarily translate to high net earnings or tax payments (a topic further illuminated in his tax disclosures).

## International Business Interests

By 2013, the Trump Organization had grown from a New York-centric real estate company into a global brand. Between 2013 and 2017, Trump pursued and maintained business interests in numerous foreign countries, often via partnerships and licensing deals. These **international ventures** were a significant aspect of his financial dealings, raising both business opportunities and potential conflicts. Key highlights of Trump’s international business interests in this period include:

- **Real Estate Projects Abroad:** Trump’s name became attached to luxury real estate on several continents. In **Asia**, Trump had multiple projects in **India** – such as Trump-branded condominium towers in Pune and Mumbai (with local developers Panchshil Realty and Lodha Group, respectively), as well as planned projects in Kolkata and Gurgaon. These were typically licensing deals where Trump received fees or a share of revenue in exchange for the use of his brand. In **the Philippines**, Trump licensed his name to the Trump Tower in Manila (opened 2016), partnering with Filipino developer Century City; notably, that developer (Jose E.B. Antonio) was later appointed as a special envoy to the U.S., highlighting blurred lines between Trump’s business partners and foreign governments. In **Western Europe**, Trump’s focus was on his golf properties in Scotland and Ireland (Turnberry and Doonbeg) which he owned outright and which drew international tourist clientele. He also explored building a Trump-branded tower in **Germany** (a deal in Frankfurt was rumored but not realized). 

- **Former Soviet Union & Middle East:** Trump long sought a real estate deal in **Russia**, and during 2015–2016 his organization (via attorney Michael Cohen) actively negotiated for a potential **Trump Tower Moscow**. In late 2015, Trump signed a letter of intent with a Russian developer to build a Moscow tower, pursuing it even into the election year ([The Trump Organization - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization#:~:text=,forward%20with%20new%20domestic%20agreements)). The project ultimately fell through by 2017, but it demonstrated Trump’s willingness to engage in foreign deals even while running for president. In the **Caucasus region**, Trump had a flashy but ill-fated project in **Azerbaijan** – the Trump Tower Baku (a planned luxury hotel/residence) developed by partners linked to an Azerbaijani oligarch. The building was nearly completed but never opened, and in December 2016 the Trump Organization withdrew from the project amid concerns over corruption and money laundering associated with the local partner (the Mammadov family) ([The Trump Organization - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization#:~:text=,forward%20with%20new%20domestic%20agreements)). Trump also had an agreement in **Georgia** for a tower in Batumi, but that too was canceled after his election as part of “no new deals” pledges ([The Trump Organization - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization#:~:text=,forward%20with%20new%20domestic%20agreements)). In the **Middle East**, Trump’s most prominent business partner was **Damac Properties in Dubai, UAE** – which licensed the Trump name for two golf courses and villa developments. The Trump International Golf Club Dubai opened in February 2017 to fanfare, with Trump’s sons attending the ribbon-cutting in his stead. This partnership with billionaire Hussain Sajwani (Damac’s chairman) brought Trump millions in fees and has continued to expand. Trump’s business also received valuable trademarks in **China** during 2016–2017 (for the Trump name in various industries), coinciding with his presidency, which raised questions about foreign governments’ treatment of his brand.

- **Latin America and Other Regions:** Trump launched and operated a few ventures in Latin America. The **Trump Ocean Club in Panama** (opened 2011) was a major hotel-condo tower bearing his name; by 2015–2017, it became embroiled in controversy. An investigation suggested some units in the project were bought by individuals tied to drug money laundering, taking advantage of the Trump brand’s cachet ([Narco-a-lago: Money Laundering at Trump Ocean Club Panama](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/narco-a-lago-panama/#:~:text=Narco,that%20bore%20Donald%20Trump%27s%20name)). Though Trump was just the licensor and manager, the Panama project illustrated how **foreign capital of dubious origin flowed into Trump-branded developments**, an issue flagged by watchdog groups ([Donald Trump Settlement & Lawsuits – History of Legal Affairs](https://crushthelsatexam.com/deep-dive-donald-trumps-long-history-of-lawsuits/#:~:text=Lawsuits%20)). In **Uruguay**, Trump had a licensing deal for a tower in Punta del Este, and in **Dominican Republic** an earlier resort project (launched in 2007 then stalled) was revived in 2017, skirting Trump’s pledge of “no new foreign deals” by classifying it as an extension of a pre-existing contract ([The Trump Organization - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization#:~:text=,forward%20with%20new%20domestic%20agreements)) ([The Trump Organization - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization#:~:text=to%20do%20no%20new%20foreign,forward%20with%20new%20domestic%20agreements)). Trump’s organization also pulled back from at least one project in **Brazil** (a planned hotel in Rio de Janeiro) amid legal troubles there ([The Trump Organization - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization#:~:text=,forward%20with%20new%20domestic%20agreements)). 

- **Foreign Partners and Alliances:** Across these international deals, Trump’s business **partnered with powerful foreign business figures**, some with political connections. In Turkey, Trump had licensed his name to Trump Towers Istanbul (opened 2010 by the Doğan Group), and in 2016 he acknowledged, “I have a little conflict of interest because I have a major, major building in Istanbul” – highlighting how business ties overlapped with geopolitics. In India, several Trump partners were influential developers with ties to India’s ruling party, and they even joined Trump’s inauguration celebrations in Washington ([The Trump Organization - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization#:~:text=Also%20in%20March%202017%2C%20Forbes,98)). According to *Forbes*, at least **14 international “mini-Trump” partners attended Trump’s inauguration in January 2017**, some paying $18,000 a night for hotel suites ([The Trump Organization - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization#:~:text=Also%20in%20March%202017%2C%20Forbes,98)). This was an early sign of **foreign business allies seeking access to the new president**, effectively blending business with diplomacy. Additionally, some foreign governments directly interacted with Trump’s businesses – for example, the **Chinese government-owned Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (ICBC)** was a major tenant at Trump Tower in New York, and **embassies and government groups from countries like Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia** began booking events at Trump’s D.C. hotel once it opened. All of these instances underscored that Trump’s international business interests not only provided income, but also created a web of relationships with foreign entities that were unprecedented for an incoming U.S. president.

In summary, between 2013 and 2017, Trump’s business was **deeply global**. He earned sizable fees from deals in far-flung locations and invested in a few flagship overseas properties. These international interests sometimes led to entanglements with foreign officials and controversial partners. By the time he took office, Trump had **ongoing business dealings or brand stakes in dozens of countries**, raising concerns that U.S. foreign policy could intersect with Trump’s personal financial interests. Indeed, the breadth of Trump’s international business during this period set the stage for many of the conflict-of-interest debates that would emerge during his presidency.

## Legal & Bankruptcy Issues

Trump’s financial dealings from 2013 to 2017 were accompanied by a number of legal challenges, lawsuits, and investigations. While Trump **did not declare any personal bankruptcies in this timeframe**, several of his past ventures’ bankruptcies (especially casino projects) influenced his limited access to traditional bank financing. Moreover, ongoing legal issues and new disputes arose related to his businesses, some revealing details about his finances. Key legal and financial controversy highlights include:

- **Trump University Fraud Case:** One of the most prominent legal battles was over Trump University, a for-profit real estate seminar program that operated from 2005 to 2010. In August 2013, New York’s Attorney General sued Trump University (and Trump personally as its figurehead) for fraud, alleging it defrauded over 5,000 students out of about $40 million ([Personal and business legal affairs of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_and_business_legal_affairs_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=Wikipedia%20en,40%20million%20for%20the)). As the case gained attention during the 2016 campaign, Trump initially vowed never to settle. However, shortly after winning the election, he agreed in November 2016 to a **$25 million settlement** to resolve the three lawsuits (the NY AG case and two class actions) ([Trump University - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_University#:~:text=Trump%20University%20was%20also%20the,8)) ([Trump University - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_University#:~:text=sales%20tactics,8)). The settlement – finalized in early 2017 – provided restitution to former students and ended the investigation without admission of wrongdoing. This outcome spared Trump the spectacle of a fraud trial while president-elect, but the case stands as a major financial legal issue directly tied to his business practices.

- **Trump Foundation Investigations:** Trump’s charity, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, came under state investigation for misuse of funds. In late 2016, reporting by *The Washington Post* uncovered that Trump had used foundation money to settle certain business legal disputes and purchase personal items (like a portrait of himself) ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=In%20January%202022%2C%20a%20filing,180%20%5D%20and%20ultimately)) ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=reported%20that%20Trump%27s%20tax%20documents,net%20worth%20by%20billions%20of)). The New York Attorney General opened an inquiry, and the foundation admitted some “self-dealing” in its 2015 IRS filings. Under mounting pressure, Trump announced in December 2016 that he would dissolve the foundation to avoid any conflict. However, the NY Attorney General blocked its dissolution pending further investigation. This culminated in a post-2017 lawsuit that found the foundation’s funds had often been used for Trump’s or his campaign’s benefit. Eventually, in 2018–2019, the foundation was shut down by court order and Trump paid a $2 million restitution to charities. While the final resolution came after 2017, the groundwork – **allegations of Trump blending charitable funds with business/political expenses** – was laid during our period, illustrating another facet of legal risk tied to Trump’s financial behavior.

- **Business Lawsuits and Contractor Disputes:** Trump’s companies faced numerous routine lawsuits – from unpaid contractors to trademark disputes – as is common in the real estate industry. Notably, the Trump International Hotel D.C. project saw lawsuits from chefs José Andrés and Geoffrey Zakarian in 2015 after they withdrew from restaurant deals in the hotel (following Trump’s controversial comments about immigrants). Those suits, which sought damages for breach of contract, were settled confidentially in 2017. Trump’s companies were also sued over issues at his golf resorts (for example, a 2013 lawsuit by members of Trump National Golf Club Jupiter in Florida over refunded deposits, which Trump settled in 2017 for over $5 million). Additionally, in Scotland, Trump unsuccessfully sued the Scottish government in 2015 trying to stop an offshore wind farm that he claimed ruined the view from his Aberdeenshire golf course ([Donald Trump buys Irish golf resort after losing Scotland court battle](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/feb/11/donald-trump-irish-golf-scotland-windfarm#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%20buys%20Irish%20golf,his%20golf%20resort%20in)). He lost that case and later pivoted to buying Turnberry on the other coast. No new Trump corporate bankruptcies occurred in 2013–2017, but an **important chapter closed in Atlantic City**: by 2014, Trump had completely exited his last casino holdings. Trump Plaza shuttered in 2014, and the Trump Taj Mahal (by then owned by Carl Icahn, though still bearing Trump’s name) closed in 2016. These closures ended Trump’s long-troubled casino ventures, which had gone through multiple bankruptcies in prior decades – meaning by 2016, potential liabilities from those past failures were largely behind him.

- **Tax Audits and Evasion Allegations:** Trump repeatedly stated that his taxes were under continuous audit by the IRS (he claimed since around 2002), which he used as a rationale for not disclosing his tax returns. In 2016, Trump’s lawyers issued a letter confirming he was under audit for tax years 2009 onward, but that raised questions as audits usually don’t span so many consecutive years without resolution ([Tax returns of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_returns_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=Tax%20returns%20of%20Donald%20Trump,to%20release%20his%20tax)). There were implications that Trump engaged in aggressive tax avoidance. In fact, a **2014 IRS audit resulted in Trump having to refund $25 million in tax credits** he had improperly claimed (related to a conservation easement at his New Jersey golf course) ([Never-Before-Seen Trump Tax Documents Show Major ... - ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-never-before-seen-trump-tax-documents-show-major-inconsistencies#:~:text=Never,profits%20and%20occupancy%20figures)). While Trump often said “I pay hundreds of millions in taxes,” investigative journalists and authorities suspected he minimized taxable income via reported business losses. This was supported by leaked records: in October 2016, the *New York Times* obtained Trump’s 1995 state tax filings showing a $916 million net operating loss that could have allowed him to avoid federal income taxes for up to 18 years. Trump never denied the authenticity of that report, famously saying in a debate that if he paid no taxes some years, it was “because I’m smart.”

- **Investigations into Financial Ties:** By 2017, with Trump in the White House, some probes began focusing on the Trump Organization’s finances. The Special Counsel investigation (Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian election interference) reportedly examined Trump’s business for any Russia connections, though Mueller largely steered clear of a deep financial investigation. Separately, media and congressional inquiries looked at whether Trump’s businesses were vehicles for **foreign influence or illicit money**. For example, **Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS testified to Congress in 2017** that Trump’s golf courses in Scotland and Ireland seemed to be inexplicably cash-heavy investments – *“hundreds of millions of dollars… and these golf courses are just sinks. They don’t actually make money”* ([Turnberry (golf course) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnberry_(golf_course)#:~:text=Financing%20for%20Trump%27s%20golf%20courses,sources%20and%20%E2%80%93%20or%20at)) – raising the specter that outside funds (possibly Russian or other foreign money) could be propping them up. Around the same time, *Global Witness* published a detailed report suggesting the Trump Ocean Club in Panama had been used to launder proceeds from Colombian cartels ([Narco-a-lago: Money Laundering at Trump Ocean Club Panama](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/narco-a-lago-panama/#:~:text=Narco,that%20bore%20Donald%20Trump%27s%20name)). These were not formal charges against Trump, but they underscored growing **concerns about money laundering and financial impropriety** in Trump’s international dealings. 

In essence, Donald Trump’s financial world in 2013–2017 was under legal scrutiny from multiple angles – fraud allegations, contract disputes, tax audits, and ethics investigations. While Trump often settled major lawsuits (Trump University, contractor cases) to mitigate risk, the pattern of accusations – that he had misled students, stiffed vendors, and skirted tax laws – painted a picture of **legally aggressive business practices**. The resolution of some issues (settlements) did remove immediate liabilities, but Trump headed into 2017 still facing questions about his taxes and the integrity of his business conduct, issues that would continue to shadow his presidency.

## Political & Business Overlaps

Trump’s entry into politics in 2015 and his eventual presidency in 2017 created unprecedented overlaps between his business interests and political role. During 2013–2017, as Trump transitioned from private businessman to public officeholder, there were numerous concerns and examples of **potential conflicts of interest, blurred lines between campaign finances and business, and instances where political and business interests intersected**:

- **Refusal to Divest and Conflict Concerns:** Unlike previous presidents, Donald Trump chose *not* to divest from his vast business holdings upon taking office. In January 2017, he announced that he would retain ownership of the Trump Organization but hand day-to-day control to his sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, and a trust overseen by them and CFO Allen Weisselberg ([The Trump Organization - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization#:~:text=resign%20and%20his%20sons%20Donald%C2%A0Jr,93)) ([The Trump Organization - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization#:~:text=Trump%20retained%20his%20financial%20stake,magazine%20reported%20in%20March%202017)). He explicitly **did not put his assets into a blind trust**, meaning he remained aware of his business interests. Ethics experts warned that as long as Trump owned the business, foreign and domestic actors might try to curry favor by patronizing his properties ([The Trump Organization - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization#:~:text=Eric%20Trump%2C%20in%20the%20Forbes,ethics%20lawyer%2C%20%20427%20Richard)) ([The Trump Organization - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization#:~:text=and%20President%20George%20W,97)). The Trump Organization did pledge to pursue “no new foreign deals” during his presidency ([The Trump Organization - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization#:~:text=assets%20would%20be%20overseen%20by,414%20reported%20in%20March%202017)), cancelling a few pending projects abroad (like those in Azerbaijan and Georgia) ([The Trump Organization - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization#:~:text=,forward%20with%20new%20domestic%20agreements)). However, they continued domestic projects and even *international* projects that were arguably pre-existing. The decision to maintain ownership set the stage for ongoing conflict-of-interest debates. For instance, the U.S. **Constitution’s Emoluments Clause** prohibits a president from receiving payments from foreign states. Almost immediately after inauguration, Trump was hit with lawsuits (by watchdog groups and the Attorneys General of D.C. and Maryland) alleging that his businesses’ receipt of foreign government patronage – such as diplomats staying at the D.C. hotel or foreign state-owned companies renting space in Trump buildings – violated the Emoluments Clause. These lawsuits progressed through courts in 2017, bringing into focus the **unprecedented situation of a president financially benefiting from government clients**. (Trump vehemently denied any conflict, calling the clause “phony,” and ultimately, the cases were dismissed or dropped on technical grounds after a couple of years, without Trump having to fully divest or disclose all foreign payments.)

- **Campaign Funds and Trump Businesses:** During the 2016 campaign, Trump frequently touted that he was “self-funding” and not beholden to donors. In reality, while he did put tens of millions of his own money into the primary, he also started raising significant donor funds by the general election ([Donald Trump's big money bait-and-switch – Center for Public Integrity](https://publicintegrity.org/politics/donald-trumps-big-money-bait-and-switch/#:~:text=Make%20no%20mistake%3A%20He%20has,of%20federal%20campaign%20finance%20disclosures)) ([Donald Trump's big money bait-and-switch – Center for Public Integrity](https://publicintegrity.org/politics/donald-trumps-big-money-bait-and-switch/#:~:text=Trump%20is%20not%20exclusively%20self,his%20campaign)). A notable portion of campaign and Republican Party spending went straight back into Trump’s companies. For example, the Trump campaign rented office space at Trump Tower, held events at Trump-owned hotels and resorts, and even paid Trump’s private aviation company for use of his airplane. By one estimate, **approximately $12.8 million of campaign and PAC funds was paid to Trump-owned entities during the 2016 campaign** (covering everything from Mar-a-Lago event catering to Trump jet fuel) ([The Trump Organization - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization#:~:text=Also%20in%20March%202017%2C%20Forbes,98)). Essentially, donor contributions helped boost Trump’s business revenue. This “circular flow” of money – campaign to business – was legal (services were rendered), but highly unusual in scale. Furthermore, after Trump’s win, the Republican National Committee and other political groups patronized Trump properties for dinners, conferences, and fundraisers. Mar-a-Lago became a favored destination for GOP events in 2017, and the Trump International Hotel in Washington turned into a hotspot for political gatherings. The **Trumps even doubled Mar-a-Lago’s initiation fee** after the election (to $200,000), effectively monetizing Trump’s status. These overlaps invited criticism that Trump was using public service to enrich his private interests.

- **Foreign Government Patronage:** Foreign governments and diplomats appeared eager to direct business to Trump’s hotels, which sparked controversy about buying influence. In late 2016, the **Embassy of Kuwait abruptly moved its annual gala from another hotel to the Trump International Hotel in D.C.**, reportedly under political pressure. Around the same time, a group of **Saudi-funded lobbyists booked over 500 nights** at the Trump D.C. hotel in late 2016, spending about $270,000 while lobbying on U.S. legislation – effectively putting money in the president-elect’s pocket ([Saudi-Funded Lobbyists Pay for Rooms at Trump Hotel, Trump Jr.'s ...](https://sunlightfoundation.com/2018/12/07/this-week-in-conflicts-saudi-funded-lobbyists-pay-for-rooms-at-trump-hotel-trump-jr-s-lettuce-company-and-subpoenas-issued-in-emoluments-lawsuit/#:~:text=Saudi,Subpoenas%20Issued%20in)). In 2017, the kingdom of **Saudi Arabia, the government of Malaysia, diplomats from Bahrain, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and others** all hosted events or stayed at Trump’s D.C. hotel. The *Washington Post* calculated that by September 2017, **foreign governments had spent at least $1.2 million at Trump’s D.C. hotel**. Trump even acknowledged in a January 2017 interview that foreign officials **“were paying me a fortune” at his hotels** but insisted, without detail, “I don’t care… I don’t even want the money” ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=Democrats%20released%20a%20report%20showing,51)) ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=January%2010%2C%20during%20a%20Fox,51)). These arrangements were precisely the kind of entanglement critics feared: foreign money flowing to a sitting president’s business. It put Trump at odds with past norms of presidents divesting or insulating themselves from such financial interests.

- **Policy Influence and Business Interests:** There were instances where Trump’s policy positions and his business interests appeared to intersect. For example, Trump’s initially tough stance on Qatar during a 2017 Gulf diplomatic crisis softened not long after a **Qatari sovereign fund considered investing in a troubled Manhattan property owned by his son-in-law Jared Kushner** (666 Fifth Avenue). While Trump’s change of tone could have had many reasons, the timing led to speculation about business influencing policy. Another instance: in China, Trump reversed a ban on the telecom firm ZTE in 2018 after China granted his businesses lucrative trademarks – this was after 2017, but the groundwork (Chinese trademarks to Trump Organization) occurred early in his term. More concretely in our period, Trump’s handling of the **Trump Organization’s project in Cuba** was scrutinized. Reports emerged in 2016 that a Trump company secretly spent money in Cuba (in violation of the U.S. embargo) in 1998 to explore business there ([Trump International Golf Links and Hotel Ireland - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_International_Golf_Links_and_Hotel_Ireland#:~:text=Wikipedia%20en.wikipedia.org%20%20,Retrieved%2011%20February%202014)). This didn’t result in legal action at the time, but politically it undercut Trump’s rhetoric with Cuban-American voters and revealed past corporate behavior at odds with U.S. policy. It exemplified how Trump’s business activities – past and present – became political liabilities or questions on the campaign trail.

- **“Blurred Lines” After Inauguration:** Once Trump was president, his properties often became backdrops for government business. He regularly traveled on weekends to Trump-branded properties (Mar-a-Lago in FL, Bedminster in NJ), effectively advertising them. Foreign delegations learned that visiting Trump at his **“Winter White House” Mar-a-Lago** or playing a round of golf at Trump’s course could be a way to get informal time with him. This blending of official and private venues was unprecedented. By one count, Trump visited one of his properties on **over 100 days in 2017**, sending a clear signal of their continued importance to him. Ethics watchdogs noted that domestic interest groups also booked Trump hotels for conferences to be **“where the action is.”** In one striking case, the **American Cancer Society moved a longtime gala to Mar-a-Lago in early 2017** – but then, facing public pressure, reversed that decision later that year. Dozens of charities grappled with whether to hold events at Trump’s clubs, weighing the prestige or access against ethical concerns. 

In summary, the 2013–2017 period saw the **wall between Trump’s business empire and political life effectively demolished**. Trump’s campaign and presidency were in constant interplay with his private financial interests. He often insisted “I won’t have time for business if I become president,” yet deliberately kept ownership of that business. The result was a level of potential conflict never seen before in American politics – prompting new scrutiny, lawsuits, and an ongoing public debate about reforming ethics laws for high office. Trump’s dual identity as president and businessman in 2017 posed questions that went to the heart of constitutional and ethical norms, many of which remained unresolved at the time.

 ([File:Trump International Hotel, Washington, DC.jpg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Trump_International_Hotel,_Washington,_DC.jpg)) *The Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. became a focal point of conflict-of-interest concerns. Foreign governments, lobbyists, and political groups patronized the hotel once Trump was president, providing **payments to Trump’s business while he was in office** ([Saudi-Funded Lobbyists Pay for Rooms at Trump Hotel, Trump Jr.'s ...](https://sunlightfoundation.com/2018/12/07/this-week-in-conflicts-saudi-funded-lobbyists-pay-for-rooms-at-trump-hotel-trump-jr-s-lettuce-company-and-subpoenas-issued-in-emoluments-lawsuit/#:~:text=Saudi,Subpoenas%20Issued%20in)) ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=Democrats%20released%20a%20report%20showing,51)). This raised Emoluments Clause issues and led to multiple lawsuits alleging that Trump was improperly profiting from the presidency.*  

## Tax & Financial Disclosures

Donald Trump’s taxes and financial disclosures from 2013 through 2017 were the subject of intense interest and speculation, given his unusual refusal to release his tax returns and the insight such documents could provide into his finances. Over this period, what became publicly known about Trump’s tax and financial picture came from a mix of required disclosure forms, investigative journalism, and leaks. Here is a summary of key information and events regarding Trump’s taxes and financial disclosures:

- **Personal Financial Disclosure (PFD) Filings:** As a presidential candidate and then president, Trump was required to file annual financial disclosure reports. In July 2015, he filed his first PFD with the Federal Election Commission, which *for the first time revealed broad details of his income, assets, and debts*. Trump reported **over $1.4 billion in assets** and a minimum of **$265 million in liabilities** on that 92-page form ([Donald Trump wealth details released by federal regulators – Deseret News](https://www.deseret.com/2015/7/22/20484466/donald-trump-wealth-details-released-by-federal-regulators/#:~:text=donors.)) ([Donald Trump wealth details released by federal regulators – Deseret News](https://www.deseret.com/2015/7/22/20484466/donald-trump-wealth-details-released-by-federal-regulators/#:~:text=The%20report%20shows%20his%20assets,of%20at%20least%20%24265%20million)). The filing also showed **at least $362 million in gross income for 2014** alone ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=Trump%20reported%20a%20yearly%20income,142)). Notably, the form detailed hundreds of Trump business entities and scores of income sources. It highlighted, for example, that Trump earned **over $5 million from a Panama real estate project, over $1 million in Turkey licensing royalties, and similar seven-figure sums from projects in the UAE, India, and the Philippines** ([Donald Trump wealth details released by federal regulators – Deseret News](https://www.deseret.com/2015/7/22/20484466/donald-trump-wealth-details-released-by-federal-regulators/#:~:text=reflect%20his%20wealth,from%20a%20developer%20in%20Panama)). These disclosures, however, use wide ranges (e.g. “over $50 million”) and report revenue, not net profit, which Trump himself criticized as not fully representing his net worth ([Donald Trump wealth details released by federal regulators – Deseret News](https://www.deseret.com/2015/7/22/20484466/donald-trump-wealth-details-released-by-federal-regulators/#:~:text=It%27s%20impossible%20to%20tell%20from,from%20a%20developer%20in%20Panama)). Trump filed updated disclosures in 2016 and 2017, which indicated changes such as the sale of the Miss Universe pageant (listed as an asset valued $5–25 million) ([Donald Trump Sells the Miss Universe Organization - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-sells-miss-universe-img-2015-9#:~:text=According%20to%20Trump%27s%20financial%20disclosure,5%20million%20and%20%2425%20million)) and the winding down of some corporate positions as he assumed office. But overall, the PFDs reinforced that Trump had **global income streams and significant debt**, without giving a complete picture of profitability or liquidity.

- **Refusal to Release Tax Returns:** Breaking with a tradition followed by every major-party presidential nominee since the 1970s, Trump steadfastly refused to voluntarily release his tax returns during the 2016 campaign or after winning. Initially, he claimed he would release them, but later cited an ongoing IRS audit as the reason he could not (even though the IRS stated that audits do not bar individuals from releasing their own returns) ([Tax returns of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_returns_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=Tax%20returns%20of%20Donald%20Trump,to%20release%20his%20tax)). This refusal led to widespread speculation about what Trump’s taxes might hide – possibilities discussed included lower-than-claimed income, paying little or no federal tax, high debt levels, or ties to foreign entities. During 2016, there were a couple of partial leaks: in October, the *New York Times* revealed that Trump declared a **$916 million loss in 1995**, which could have legally enabled him to avoid federal income taxes for many subsequent years ([Trump University - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_University#:~:text=In%202011%2C%20the%20company%20became,7)). And in March 2017, a journalist obtained two pages of Trump’s 2005 tax return, showing Trump earned $153 million that year and paid $36.5 million in taxes – but importantly, $31 million of that was due to the Alternative Minimum Tax, a provision Trump later sought to eliminate. These glimpses suggested that in profitable years Trump used available loopholes to minimize tax, and in unprofitable years he may have paid nothing.

- **The New York Times 2020 Investigation (covering 2013–2017):** In September 2020 – just before the first presidential debate – *The New York Times* published an extensive analysis of two decades of Trump’s tax return data (which it had obtained confidentially). The report’s findings covering the mid-2010s were striking. It confirmed that Trump **paid **only $750 in federal income taxes in 2016** and another **$750 in 2017** ([NY Times: Trump paid $750 in US income taxes in 2016, 2017](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-business-ny-state-wire-ap-top-news-nyc-wire-f0e2af5f9f99de9d30dc6b9097121188#:~:text=The%20president%20in%202017%20paid,The%20Times)). In 10 of the 15 years before 2016, Trump paid **zero** income tax, largely because he reported huge business losses that wiped out profits ([NY Times: Trump paid $750 in US income taxes in 2016, 2017](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-business-ny-state-wire-ap-top-news-nyc-wire-f0e2af5f9f99de9d30dc6b9097121188#:~:text=NY%20Times%3A%20Trump%20paid%20%24750,The%20Times)). For example, the Times revealed Trump had claimed **$700+ million in losses from his companies between 2009 and 2014**, resulting in minimal taxable income. In 2015, the year he launched his campaign, Trump’s tax returns reported a loss of $32 million and no federal tax due. Intriguingly, the data showed that in 2017 Trump’s U.S. businesses continued to lose money overall, but his foreign ventures paid significant taxes abroad – that year he paid **$145,400 in taxes to India and $156,824 to the Philippines** on income from projects there, while paying only $750 to the U.S. government ([Donald Trump paid 193 times more taxes in India compared to US in ...](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/donald-trump-paid-193-times-more-taxes-in-india-compared-to-us-in-2016-report-11601272256839.html#:~:text=,750%20in%20US%20income%20taxes)). Such details raised questions about Trump’s true financial health (how could a self-proclaimed billionaire have so many losing businesses?) and about **potential tax avoidance strategies**. The Times report also noted Trump was fighting the IRS over a disputed $72.9 million tax refund he claimed in 2010 (related to carrying back the 2008–09 losses) ([NY Times: Trump paid $750 in US income taxes in 2016, 2017](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-business-ny-state-wire-ap-top-news-nyc-wire-f0e2af5f9f99de9d30dc6b9097121188#:~:text=NY%20Times%3A%20Trump%20paid%20%24750,The%20Times)) – an audit issue that, if resolved against him, could cost him over $100 million. These revelations, though published in 2020, directly illuminated Trump’s financial picture during 2013–2017, showing a pattern of large losses offsetting income to reduce tax liability.

- **Congressional and Other Disclosures:** In 2017, Democrats in Congress began efforts to obtain Trump’s tax returns, citing oversight and potential conflicts (efforts that would eventually, years later, result in Congress obtaining and releasing six years of his returns in 2022). Also in early 2017, the Office of Government Ethics released Trump’s trust paperwork and a letter indicating how his business would (or would not) separate from his presidency. The OGE also publicly pressed the White House on issues like reporting foreign emoluments and hotel profits that might need to be turned over to the U.S. Treasury. Trump’s accountants and lawyers provided some information in defense of his practices – for instance, Trump’s tax attorneys affirmed that he had been under continuous audit and that he paid “all taxes required by law,” while also acknowledging he claimed large depreciation and business losses. However, those statements were not backed by documentation at the time. It wasn’t until the later leaks and investigations that the public got a more concrete look. 

- **Net Worth Claims vs. Documented Figures:** Throughout 2013–2017, Trump loudly insisted he was worth $10 billion or more, but publicly available documents didn’t support that. Forbes and Bloomberg estimated his net worth to be in the $3–4.5 billion range during 2015–2017. In 2015, Trump’s own lawyers, in a bid to secure a lease (for the D.C. hotel), submitted financial statements showing high asset values – but these came under question. In fact, years later, the New York Attorney General would allege that those **Statements of Financial Condition (2011–2013)** contained inflated valuations (part of a civil fraud suit) ([Following Mazars' Disavowal of Trump's Financial Statements ...](https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/news/press-releases/following-mazars-disavowal-of-trump-s-financial-statements-chairs-maloney-and#:~:text=...%20oversightdemocrats.house.gov%20%20,of%20Statements%20of%20Financial)). While not adjudicated during 2013–2017, it suggests that even the financial “disclosures” Trump made to business counterparties may have been rosier than reality. Conversely, for tax purposes, Trump appears to have deflated values and profits. This dichotomy – **inflating assets when useful for loans, deflating income when useful for taxes** – became a point of investigative focus. Trump’s longtime accounting firm, Mazars USA, stood by his numbers during this period, but in 2022 even they would disavow a decade of Trump’s financial statements as unreliable ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=In%20January%202022%2C%20a%20filing,180%20%5D%20and%20ultimately)) ([Wealth of Donald Trump - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=reported%20that%20Trump%27s%20tax%20documents,180%20%5D%20and%20ultimately)).

In summary, between 2013 and 2017 the public’s knowledge of Trump’s finances grew incrementally but was still limited. We learned through required disclosures that he had an expansive, complex business with vast revenues and substantial debts. Yet Trump’s unwillingness to share his tax returns meant that for years, crucial details about profitability, tax strategies, and possible financial entanglements remained obscured. It was only through investigative reporting (and later legal battles) that a clearer picture emerged: one of a business magnate who, despite hundreds of millions in revenue, **often paid little or no federal income tax** due to reported losses, and whose self-portrayal of billionaire success was undercut by the less glamorous reality in his ledgers. These revelations from the 2013–2017 period have provided a far deeper understanding of Donald Trump’s financial dealings – highlighting the sharp contrasts between public statements, legal obligations, and private financial behavior.
