# Chapter 6: 2021–2025 — Post-Presidency Realities and Continuing Influence Risks  
**Assessing the Ongoing Saga of Trump’s Foreign Entanglements with Russia**  

---

## Introduction  

This chapter examines Donald J. Trump’s activities, statements, and investigations from the moment he left the White House in January 2021 through March 2025, focusing on whether his ties to Russia—and perceptions of Russian leverage—evolved, diminished, or persisted. Building on Chapter 5’s account of the 2015–2021 era, we analyze how Trump’s post-presidential business dealings, legal challenges, and public posture on Russia maintained a through line of controversy and scrutiny. Additionally, this chapter addresses how the Russian government itself has reacted to Trump’s post-2021 political endeavors, culminating in fresh debates about foreign influence during the 2024 election cycle.

## 1. Post-Presidency Business Dealings (2021–2025)

### 1.1 Legacy of Past Russian Investments

After leaving office, Donald Trump’s business ventures remained under scrutiny for allegedly attracting Russian-linked capital:

- Past sales of Trump-branded condos to Russian buyers—including an estimated $98 million total in Florida properties—continued to raise questions about potential money laundering.  
  - [Source: “Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings” (Reuters Investigates)](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=A%20Reuters%20review%20found%20that,luxury%20towers%20in%20southern%20Florida)  
- While Trump did not announce any new real estate projects in Russia itself post-2021, oversight committees and journalists kept examining opaque shell-company purchases tied to wealthy Russians in Trump properties.  
  - [Ibid.](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/#:~:text=But%20in%20the%20United%20States%2C,documents%2C%20interviews%20and%20corporate%20records)

Such longstanding transactions, though not illegal per se, have fueled continued suspicions that Russian money sought favorable access to Trump’s brand or potential political influence.

### 1.2 Deutsche Bank Break and Financing Shifts

- **Deutsche Bank**, Trump’s main lender for decades, cut ties weeks after the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot. This ended a fraught relationship that once drew scrutiny for possible Russian-related money-laundering connections.  
  - [Source: “Deutsche Bank cuts ties with Trump after Capitol attack” (Politico)](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/12/deutsche-bank-cuts-ties-trump-458193#:~:text=Deutsche%20Bank%2C%20one%20of%20President,finances%20once%20he%20leaves%20office)  
- Trump refinanced or paid off much of his Deutsche Bank debt by mid-2022, replacing loans with smaller U.S. lenders like Axos Bank. Congressional efforts to obtain Trump’s Deutsche Bank records persisted, aiming to assess foreign financing risks.  
  - [Source: House Intelligence Committee Press Release, inquiries into Trump’s finances](https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1042#:~:text=In%20February%202019%2C%20Schiff%20announced,them%2C%20remains%20urgent%20and%20outstanding)

### 1.3 Russian-Linked Lifeline to Trump’s Media Venture

- In 2022, Trump’s new social media startup (Truth Social) reportedly received $8 million in emergency loans from a Dominica-registered bank with ties to a Russian-American financier under federal investigation.  
  - [Source: “Trump’s Truth Social media company ‘propped up in 2022 by Russian-American under criminal investigation’” (The Independent)](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-truth-social-emergency-loans-b2522794.html#:~:text=The%20broadsheet%20cites%20leaked%20documents,role%20in%20the%20TMTG%20merger)  
- Though no charges were filed against Trump Media, congressional critics raised the specter of Russian money infiltrating his enterprises yet again.  

Overall, post-White House business dealings reflected **legacy entanglements rather than new ventures**—but questions persisted on whether Russian-connected funds played a quiet supporting role.

## 2. Political and Public Statements on Russia (2021–2025)

### 2.1 Praise for Putin and Ukraine Conflict Stance

- In early 2022, amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Trump called Putin’s moves “genius” and “very savvy,” drawing bipartisan criticism.  
  - [Source: “Trump condemns Russia invasion; hints again at 2024 presidential run” (Reuters)](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-condemns-russia-invasion-says-he-prays-ukrainian-people-2022-02-27/#:~:text=Trump%20had%20irked%20some%20Republican,pretty%20savvy)  
- Though he later condemned the war as “appalling,” Trump simultaneously praised Putin’s “strength” and blamed President Biden’s “weakness” for enabling the invasion.  
- Trump repeatedly claimed he could broker a Ukraine–Russia truce in “24 hours,” labeling the conflict a “disaster” but offering no specifics—raising fears he might push for concessions favoring Moscow.  
  - [Source: CNN Town Hall (AP News), May 2023](https://apnews.com/article/trump-russia-ukraine-war-un-election-a78ecb843af452b8dda1d52d137ca893#:~:text=News%20apnews,that%20done%20%E2%80%94%20I)

### 2.2 Continued Skepticism of NATO and Alignment with Russian Messaging

- Trump openly criticized NATO, boasting he had threatened not to defend allies unless they “paid up.” Such rhetoric traditionally seen as fringe within GOP ranks increasingly resonated with portions of Trump’s base.  
  - [Source: CPAC 2023 Transcript (Rev.com)](https://www.rev.com/transcripts/trump-speaks-at-cpac-2023-transcript#:~:text=match%20at%20L766%20and%20if,overnight%20mail%2C%20sir%2C%20I%20promise)

### 2.3 Denial of Russian Interference and FBI “Hoax” Claims

- Trump maintained his longstanding position that the Russia investigation was a partisan hoax, dismissing intelligence findings of Kremlin meddling in 2016 and 2020.  
- He vilified former FBI and U.S. intelligence officials involved in investigating Russian ties, asserting that not one phone call to or from Russia existed in his circles—despite contrary documentation in the Mueller Report.

Trump’s consistent admiration for Putin, hostility toward NATO, and refusal to acknowledge Russian election interference signaled continuity from his presidency, intensifying Western allies’ uncertainty.

## 3. Legal Cases and Investigations (2021–2025)

### 3.1 Durham Report’s Impact

- Special Counsel John Durham’s 2023 report criticized FBI missteps when opening “Crossfire Hurricane” in 2016, but **did not refute** that Russia interfered to aid Trump.  
  - [Source: Senate Judiciary Committee, “Graham Statement on the Durham Report”](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/graham-statement-on-the-durham-report#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)  
- Trump claimed vindication, portraying the lack of new charges as proof the “Russia collusion” narrative was fabricated. Critics noted Durham’s findings focused on FBI errors rather than clearing Trump of foreign influence.

### 3.2 House Investigations into Trump’s Foreign Financial Ties

- Democratic-led committees advanced subpoenas for Deutsche Bank records in 2021–2022, citing “counterintelligence risks” from Trump’s finances.  
  - [Source: House Intelligence Committee Renewed Subpoena (2021)](https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1042#:~:text=In%20February%202019%2C%20Schiff%20announced,them%2C%20remains%20urgent%20and%20outstanding)  
- When Republicans assumed House control in 2023, these inquiries largely ceased. No public congressional report resolved lingering questions about Trump’s Russian-linked loans and property sales.

Although no new Russia-linked criminal charges emerged, official statements reaffirmed that past investigations left possible foreign leverage issues unresolved.

## 4. The 2024 Presidential Campaign and Russian Interference

### 4.1 Kremlin-Backed Media Cheerleading

- Russian state media consistently hailed Trump’s candidacy, ridiculing his Democratic rivals and echoing his talking points on NATO and “election fraud.”  
  - [Source: “Russian state media flatters Trump, but Kremlin cool on him and Harris” (Reuters)](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/russian-state-media-flatters-trump-kremlin-cool-him-harris-2024-10-22/#:~:text=MOSCOW%2C%20Oct%2022%20%28Reuters%29%20,Donald%20Trump%20is%20strongly%20favoured)

### 4.2 Renewed Covert Influence Operations

- U.S. intelligence and law enforcement detected fresh Russian infiltration attempts:  
  - **Fake videos** falsely claiming voter fraud in Georgia, aimed at eroding trust in ballot integrity.  
  - A covert campaign (codenamed “Project Doppelganger”) to disseminate pro-Russian, pro-Trump propaganda via cloned news websites.  
  - [Source: Joint ODNI, FBI, CISA statements (2024)](https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/joint-odni-fbi-and-cisa-statement-on-russian-election-influence-efforts#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20IC%20assesses%20that%20Russian,the%20video%E2%80%99s%20claims%20as%20false)

### 4.3 Absence of Formal Coordination Evidence

- No direct conspiracy emerged tying Trump’s campaign to these Russian efforts, but the net effect benefitted Trump by smearing opponents and amplifying anti-Ukraine rhetoric.  
- Russian officials, from Dmitry Medvedev to Putin himself, offered veiled endorsements of Trump’s views on scaling back aid to Ukraine.

In sum, the 2024 race replayed elements of 2016, with Russia working more subtly yet still favoring Trump’s policies.

## 5. Policy Implications and Comparative Analysis

### 5.1 Break from Traditional GOP Orthodoxy

- Historically, Republicans championed robust support for NATO and tough stances against Russian aggression. Trump’s posture—involving praise for Putin, criticism of NATO, and talk of “deal-making” with Moscow—marked a remarkable ideological shift.  
  - [See Chapter 2 in Tmanch.md: “Policy Alignment with Foreign Interests” for historical GOP emphasis]

### 5.2 Counterintelligence Concerns

- U.S. intelligence and allied agencies remained wary of Trump’s secrecy and contradictory stances, especially the potential for compromised handling of classified materials.  
- The FBI’s lack of a deep probe into Trump’s finances left open the question of whether any undisclosed Russian deals or debts could shape his policies.  

### 5.3 Allied Anxiety and Geopolitical Consequences

- European allies openly worried about Washington possibly abandoning core commitments to NATO, effectively turning Trump’s personal foreign policy views into a strategic vulnerability.  
  - [Source: MI6 chief’s speech warning of a “dangerous pivot” if U.S. support for Ukraine wanes](https://www.the-independent.com/news/uk/home-news/mi6-chief-richard-moore-putin-russia-ukraine-b2656425.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIn%2037%20years%20in%20the,he%20will%20not%20stop%20there%E2%80%9D)

Trump’s second campaign reasserted how drastically his approach to Russia deviates from bipartisan norms, heightening concerns about global security structures.

## 6. Conclusion and Final Assessment

1. **Evidence Summary (2021–2025)**  
   - Trump’s post-presidential period featured no major new Russian business ventures, but significant Russian financial “ghosts” persisted—particularly in real estate sales, suspicious loans, and a surprise monetary infusion into his social media entity.  
   - Publicly, Trump doubled down on praising Putin and criticizing NATO, maintaining that the “Russia hoax” overshadowed true issues.  

2. **Continuing Foreign Influence Risks**  
   - Despite the Durham Report criticizing FBI methods, it did not negate Russia’s documented interference.  
   - The 2024 campaign saw renewed propaganda from Moscow to support Trump’s anti-Ukraine, anti-NATO stances, echoing how Russia sought to boost him in 2016.

3. **Recommendations**  
   - **Enhanced Financial Disclosures**: Future candidates, especially those with large foreign business footprints, should face stricter transparency regulations to mitigate foreign influence.  
   - **Robust Counterintelligence Oversight**: Congress and the FBI require clearer mandates to scrutinize potential foreign leverage arising from a candidate’s financial entanglements.  
   - **Allied Coordination**: NATO partners may need formal assurances from future U.S. administrations to maintain credible deterrence against Russian aggression, irrespective of political leadership changes in Washington.

In sum, Trump’s post-presidency did not mark a clean break from Russia-related controversies, but rather continued them in new forms—from high-level rhetoric praising Putin to tangible questions about offshore financing and disinformation in the 2024 election. As of March 2025, the Trump–Russia saga has proven durable, demonstrating how foreign entanglements and unconventional policy views can persist well beyond a presidency, shaping both domestic politics and international alliances.
